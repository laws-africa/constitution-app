      "summary": "The Senate and Council of the University of Stellenbosch adopted a new language policy in 2016. The University\u2019s previous policy, adopted in 2014, established English and Afrikaans as languages of instruction (with interpretation). Compared to the 2016 Policy, the 2014 Policy would have cost an additional R640 million in infrastructure, plus about R78 million per year thereafter, entailing a 20% increase in fees (R8100 on top of the approximately R40 000 per year per student). The 2016 Policy makes teaching primarily English: teaching is in both English and Afrikaans \u2018where reasonably practicable and pedagogically sound\u2019 (parallel medium); and where demand is insufficient and recourses do not permit, only Afrikaans translations are provided, coupled with questions and answers in Afrikaans (as opposed to real-time interpreting). At the time of the judgment, Afrikaans was still offered on large scale at undergraduate level; all first-year lectures continue to be offered in Afrikaans; any student could be taught in English.\n\nFollowing an extensive and exhaustive process, and in the wake of Fees Must Fall and Open Stellenbosch upheavals on its campus in 2015, the University of Stellenbosch adopted a new language policy in 2016 under the Higher Education Act and the National Language Policy for Higher Education (LPHE) to replace its 2014 policy which would have cost the University millions more Rands in infrastructure and annual operational costs, resulting in fee increases. The 2016 Policy makes teaching primarily English: teaching is in both English and Afrikaans; and where demand is insufficient and recourses do not permit, only Afrikaans translations are provided, coupled with questions and answers in Afrikaans. \n\nThe Court upheld the 2016 Policy which was challenged under both section 29(2) and section 6 of the Constitution, ruling that it validly replaced the 2014 Policy which was not reasonably practicable as determined by the University.",
      "snippet": "<h1>Test Heading</h1><em>This case</em> concerned the decisions of the Senate and Council of the University of Stellenbosch to adopt a new language policy for the University (2016 Policy). The applicants approached the Constitutional Court to ask for the setting aside of the 2016 Policy on grounds that it violates section 29(2), and also contravenes other constitutional provisions, including section 6(2), section 6(4), the equality clause and other provisions of the Bill of Rights.",
      "facts": "",
      "decision": "The Court ruled, in respect of the section 6 challenge, that Afrikaans did not suffer \u2018historically diminished use and status\u2019 and therefore not qualify as a disadvantaged indigenous language in terms of section 6(2), even though it did qualify as indigenous; it only qualifies and is protected as an official language under section 6(4). \n\nThe state has a much wider margin under section 6(4) than under section 6(2). Under section 6(2), the state is obliged to advance historically diminished languages through \u2018practical and positive measures\u2019 without disregarding the official languages under section 6(4). However, under section 6(4), the state is only required to treat the official languages listed equitably by not diminishing them. This means that the state cannot disregard the official languages and is obliged to conserve them, but not at the expense of corrective, advancement measures under section 6(2).\n\nUltimately, the Court acknowledged that whilst the world was growing more hostile to minority languages, it was not the University\u2019s burden to prevent the decline of Afrikaans across South African tertiary institutions.",
      "dissent": "Moegoeng CJ concurred separately, emphasizing emphasized the need to develop all indigenous languages including the spoken languages of the First Nation people. \n\nFroneman J concurred separately, laying out the implications of English dominance as a medium of instruction, namely the diminished use and protection of minority indigenous languages.",

      "summary": "The University of the Free State formalised a bilingual (Afrikaans and English) language policy in 2003 after phasing it in since 1993. The effect (although not the intention) of the policy was, amongst other things, separate lecture rooms for white and black students and reported racial tension. \r\n\r\nAfter commissioning a report on the situation within the University under the 2003 policy, the University Council adopted a new policy in 2016 (to be phased in over five years) which made English the primary medium of teaching and learning, with Afrikaans continuing to be used in an expanded tutorial system and selected courses. \n\nSection 29(2) of the Constitution entitles everyone to education in the language of their choice in public institutions where \u2018reasonably practicable\u2019, taking into account: (a) equity; (b) practicability; and (c) the need to redress the results of past racially discriminatory laws and practices\u2019.\nThe University of the Free State formalised a bilingual language policy in 2003 after phasing it in since 1993.

      "snippet": "This case was about whether the adoption of the language policy that discontinues the use of Afrkiaans as a primary medium of instruction, by the University of the Free State, is constitutionally valid and whether the University's policy is consistent with the Ministerial Language Policy Framework. AfriForum and Solidarity approached the Court as they believe that proper research was not conducted, and that most white and some black Afrikaans-speaking students prefer to be taught in Afrikaans. They see no justification for the language policy-shift. ",
      "facts": "",
      "decision": "The Court ruled that the fuelling of racial tension was an \u2018appropriate justification\u2019 for the limiting the existing access to the right to be taught in one\u2019s mother tongue. \r\nThe Court explained that it may be practically possible or feesable to retain Afrikaans as a major medium of instruction; but \u2013 given that the link between racially segregated lectures and racial tensions had not been denied \u2013 it was not \u2018reasonably practicable\u2019 to maintain the 2003 bilingual policy if that policy endangered race relations and threatened to perpetuate racial discrimination. This was decided, especially so, in light of the state\u2019s responsibility to redress the damage caused by apartheid.\r\nThe Court recognised Afrikaans as a highly developed language of scholarship and science, and a national resource to be treasured. \r\n",

      "summary": "A School Code of Conduct banned the wearing of jewellery (at school), except for plain stud earrings and wrist watches. The ban extended to any other piercings, including nose studs. A learner, taking part in a voluntary (non-compulsory) cultural and religious practice, pierced her nose and returned to school after the holidays wearing a nose stud, in contravention of the School Code of Conduct. Does the refusal of the school \u2013 in enforcing uniformity under the terms of its Code of Conduct, to which the learner consented through her parent upon admission to the school \u2013 amount to unfair discrimination and/or a violation of the learner\u2019s cultural and religious rights under sections 9 and 31 of the Constitution respectively? The Constitutional Court found that the refusal amounted to a violation of those rights; and that schools must reasonably accommodate differences and diversity in their communities. The Court found that it was legitimate (in general) for schools to promote uniformity in aiming to establish a disciplined school environment, but that exceptions (reasonable accommodations) must be allowed where demanded by the Constitution \u2013 as determined through a balancing of rights and interests. The Court ordered the School to amend its Code of Conduct to provide for exemption procedures allowing learners, on genuine cultural or religious grounds, to apply for permission to deviate from the uniform and other standards and requirements of the Code of Conduct, thereby allowing for the rights and interests to be weighed and balanced in the specific circumstances on a case-by-case basis.",
      "snippet": "This case concerned the right of a learner to wear a nose stud to school and whether the rule prohibiting the wearing of jewellery had the potential for indirect discrimination because it allowed certain groups of learners to express their religious and cultural identity freely, while denying that right to others.",
      "facts": "Ms Sunali Pillay (the learner), through her mother Ms V Pillay (the Respondent), had consented to the school Code of Conduct upon admission to the school in 2002. The Code of Conduct banned the wearing of jewellery (at school), including any piercings, and except for plain stud earrings and wrist watches. A learner, taking part in a voluntary (non-compulsory) cultural and religious practice, pierced her nose and returned to school after the holidays wearing a nose stud, in contravention of the School Code of Conduct. After consultation between the parties, and between the School and experts, the School ultimately refused to allow her to continue wearing the nose stud and sought to enforce its Code of Conduct against her through conducting a disciplinary hearing. The refusal and scheduling of a disciplinary hearing prompted Ms V Pillay (the Respondent) to launch proceedings in the Equality Court.",
      "decision": "The Court noted that whilst uniforms and school rules serve an important purpose in education, the case was not about uniforms in general, but about a specific exemption to a uniform. The Court found that permitting this particular exemption would not endanger uniformity or school discipline in general; but rather that granting an exemption to Ms Sunali Pillay (the learner) might encourage more learners to express their religion or culture, which was to be celebrated, not feared (as diversity itself is to be promoted and celebrated not only tolerated). The Court ruled that the constitutional rights and protections (namely, under section 31) apply equally to both compulsory and voluntary (non-compulsory) practices of culture and religion.",
      "dissent": "O\u2019Regan J partially dissented. O\u2019Regan J agreed with most of the order and reasons of the majority, but disagreed with the part of the order in which the Court declared the refusal by the School to allow Ms Sunali Pillay to wear the nose stud as unfair discrimination (the declaratory relief).\n\nMs Sunali Pillay had graduated and left the school before judgment was handed down by the Constitutional Court. O\u2019Regan J argued that because of this, the declaratory relief was moot (\u2018pointless\u2019) and inappropriate. O\u2019Regan contended that had Ms Sunali Pillay still be enrolled at the School by the time the Court heard the case, it would have been appropriate to refer the matter back to the School for the proper exemption procedure to be carried out in accordance with its amended Code of Conduct.",

The remedial action was never intended to be binding on the person being investigated as the Public Protector was not a judicial officer. It was also argued that the Public Protector Act watered down the powers of the Public Protector in particular the remedial powers. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was argued that in the case of the Public Protector handing down an unfavourable remedial action, the person investigated had no option but to comply with the action. A remedial action could not serve as a remedy to an injured party unless it was able to deal with the matter. Therefore, the power to take remedial action would be rendered useless if the person against whom the remedial action is taken could ignore that action.\r",

It is also important to note that in the process, the Constitutional Court heard various submissions on the final constitutional text by political parties and other civil bodies and as elaborated further below the Constitutional Court found that the draft constitutional text did not comply in all aspects with the constitutional principles and referred it back to the Constitutional Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe  Constitutional Court, was tasked with certifying the final constitutional text and the Court had to determine whether the constitutional text complied with the 34 constitutional principles in Schedule 4 of the Interim Constitution. \nThe Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment was divided in eight chapters, ranging from the context of the certification process, the interpretation of the constitutional principles to the application and interpretation of the Bill of Rights and provincial and local Government powers. \n\nThere were certain serious concerns raised by the Constitutional Court in measuring the final text against the constitutional principles. One of the concerns involved the safeguarding and protection of the independence of the Public-Protector and the Auditor-General which did not comply with Constitutional Principle CP XXIX, relating to the independence of the Public Service Commission, the Reserve Bank, an Auditor General and a Public Protector. The Constitutional Court also emphasised that the independence and impartiality of the Public Protector is critical to ensuring an accountable and effective government. As stated above the constitutional text was referred back to the Constitutional Assembly for further amendments. \n",

      "decision": "In the Constitution, section 1 refers to the founding values of the Constitution. These values emphasise that the Republic of South Africa is \u201cone, sovereign, democratic state\u201d which is founded on various core value such as human dignity, non-racialism, supremacy of the Constitution and a multi-party system of democratic governance. It is perhaps critical before briefly summarising the Constitutional Court\u2019s views on these values in the judgment to highlight that these founding values form the foundation of our constitutional order and in terms of the Constitution numerous requirements need to be met to amend these provisions.\r\nTurning to the Constitutional Court judgment, the Court emphasised that it is necessary to identify the basic structures of our new constitutional order and it was the first question the Court was faced with on certifying the final constitutional text against the 34 constitutional principles. The Constitutional Court emphasised that these structures include \u201ca constitutional democracy based on the supremacy of the Constitution protected by an independent judiciary\u201d which aligns with Constitutional principles IV, VII and XV. Furthermore, the Constitutional court emphasised the need for a \u201crepresentative government embracing multi-party democracy, a common voters\u2019 roll and, in general, proportional representation\u201d. The Constitutional Court found that the new final constitutional test satisfied the  basic structures of our new constitutional order which is now captured in section 1 of the Constitution.\r",

The respondent was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. In 1997 he however applied for amnesty under the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 and was granted it in 2001. In 2003 the respondent was a candidate to head the Ekurhuleni metro police. The appellant in September and October 2003 published various articles and editorials questioning the respondent\u2019s candidacy and expressed the view that he was a \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cmurdered\u201d. Some of the articles failed to mention that the respondent was granted amnesty by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the respondent sued the appellant and other journalists for defamation in the Witwatersrand Local Division (South Gauteng High Court), arguing that the articles were malicious as he was granted amnesty. The respondent was successful in the High Court with the defamation claim and the appellants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court of Appeal only partially upheld the appeal and reduced the amount of damages awarded to the respondent. The appellants then appealed to the constitutional Court against the Supreme Court of Appeal judgment and the respondent cross-appealed the reduction in damages awarded by the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n\nThe key issue the Constitutional Court had to determine was how amnesty granted to the respondent for crimes committed (during the struggle against apartheid) by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission affected a claim for defamation. The respondent was granted amnesty in terms of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 for crimes committed in 1986. In 2003 the appellants in various commentary covering the candidacy of the respondent for the position of head of the Erkhuleni Metro police referred to the respondent as a \u201cmurderer\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d. Justice Cameron writing for the majority geld that the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 did not make the fact that the respondent committed murder untrue and the Act did not prohibit frank public discussion. Justice Cameron emphasised that the requirement that a comment must be \u201dfair\u201d  protects criticism even if it is extreme so long it is without malice, on a matter of public interest and  on facts that are true. The Constitutional Court therefore upheld the appellant\u2019s main appeal and dismissed the respondent\u2019s cross appeal but the Court did find that the appellant had defamed the respondent by claiming falsely that he was not contrite and awarded the respondent damages on this aspect.",
      "snippet": "",
      "facts": "",
      "decision": "As the matter essentially concerned a defamation claim and the defences raised thereto a key issue the Constitutional Court had to decide was, how to find a balance between two constitutional rights, namely the appellant\u2019s right to freedom of expression on the one hand and the respondent\u2019s right to human dignity. Justice Cameron writing for the majority, emphasised that the right to human dignity is not only given separate constitutional recognition in s 10 of the Constitution but is also one of the founding values of the society terms of s 1. Therefore, a failure to uphold the right is not only a violation of s10 but is also a threat to a founding value underpinning the legitimacy of the State. However importantly Cameron J, pointed out that freedom of expression is just as important as human dignity and one cannot say that human dignity trumps freedom of expression. The law of defamation importantly must be interpreted to give effect to the appropriate balance between the right to freedom of expression on the one hand and a person\u2019s human dignity on the other hand. Cameron J held on this interpretation that the requirement that a comment must be \u201cfair\u201d in defence to a claim for defamation gives effect to the balance between the right to freedom of expression and dignity.",
      "dissent": "Partial dissenting judgments were written by Ngcobo J and Mogoeng J. Justice Ngcobo agreed with the majority judgment that the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 did not make the facts of the commission of the murders untrue but Ngcobo J held that the balancing of the right to freedom and the right to dignity  required the facts upon which the appellant relied in their comment to include the fact that the respondent was granted amnesty by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission. However, on reading the coverage of the respondent\u2019s candidacy collectively Ngcobo J found that this fact was adequately stated. Justice Ngcobo however held that since the appellant failed to make reference to the circumstances under which the appellant was released from detention in Mozambique the statement of the appellant concerning gun-running allegations in Mozambique was based on \u201chalf-truths\u201d and therefore was untrue, justifying the respondent\u2019s cross appeal. Justice Mogoeng in his judgment specifically held that the defamatory statements that the respondent was a \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cmurder \u201cmust be determined within the context of the objective of the amnesty process and that the truth told during the amnesty process was not meant to be used in a manner that defeats the purpose of national reconciliation. Justice Mogoeng held that the defamatory statements that the respondent was a \u201cmurderer\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d was malicious and was contrary to the pursuit of national reconciliation.

      "summary": "The matter was referred to the Constitutional Court by the Appelate  division of the Supreme Court, and the Constitutional Court essentially had to determine whether the death sentence  in terms of s 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 was consistent with ss 9 and 11 (2) of the Interim Constitution, concerning the right to life and the prohibition againt \u201dcruel, inhuman or degrading punishment\u201d. It is important to note that the trial was concluded before the Interim Constitution (also known as the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,1993)  came into operation and therefore the constitutionality of the death sentence was not considered  at the trial itself.\n\nChaskalson J,writing for the majority  essentially found that such an extreme form of punishment putting an end to the right to life itself and infringing on  various other constitutional rights, especially the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, could not be justified as  reasonable in terms of the limitation test in s33 of the Interim Constitution. The Constitutional Court declared  the death penalty unconstitutional.\n\nThe Constitutional Court was principally concerned with the question whether the death penalty in terms of s 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 was in conflict with various provisions of the then Interim Constitution such as the right to life, dignity and the prohibition against \u201ccruel, inhuman or degrading punishment\u201d. \n\nChaskalson P, considered various foreign judgment  and decisions of International Human Rigs  Tribunals  that  emphasised that \u201dcruel, inhuman and degrading punishment\u201d is in clear contrast to the right of dignity which is also a  founding value of the South African Constitution.\n\nChaskalson P, applied the limitation of rights test in terms of s 33 of the Interim Constitution,which involves a two-stage test to determine  whether the limitation on a constitutional right is reasonable, necessary and proportional taking into account all competing rights. Chaskalson P, specicially held that one has to ask whether the death penalty is \u201dcruel, inhumanor degrading\u201d and whether it can be justified in terms of  s 33 of the Interim Constitution.\n",

      "facts": "",
      "decision": "\nIt is important to note that the constitutionality of the death sentence triggered an analysis of various constitutional rights besides the right to life, which at the times was provided for in s 9 of the Interim Constitution. The right not to be subject to \u201ccruel, inhuman and degrading punishment\u201d and the right to dignity were also critical in the analysis. The majority judgment written by Chaskalson P, in fact focused more on the justification of the death sentence in relation to the right not to be subject on \u201ccruel, inhuman and degrading punishment\u201d in light of alternative severe sentences such as life imprisonment. It is however  important to note that Chaskalson P held that although the right to life is stated in unqualified terms, the right itself must accommodate the right to kill in lawful self-defence of one\u2019s own life or the lives of others. \n\n<p>The concurring judgment of O\u2019Reagen dealt more with the right to life and O\u2019 Reagen J  explicitly held that the death sentence was also a breach of the right to life and dignity. O\u2019Reagen J,  held that the meaning of the right to life must be considered in light of its purpose for which it was included in the Constitution. O\u2019Reagen J emphasised that the right to life is interlinked with the right to dignity and was included in the Constitution not only to preserve the right to existence but includes the right to experience humanity and is central to a society where every individual is recognised and valued.</p> [sec_11]\n\n<p>The constitutional <b>right to dignity</b> directly comes into question on consideration of the constitutionality of the death penalty. Chaskalson P,  on analysis of the right to dignity specifically considered various foreign law which prohibited capital punishment. This analysis  included  judgments by the Federal Constitutional Court in Germany which emphasised that respect for human dignity specifically requires  the prohibition of cruel punishments and that the idea is not that \u201cthe State should turn an offender into an object of crime prevention to the detriment of his constitutionally protected right to social worth and respect\u201d.</p>[sec_10]\n\n\n\n",

They indicated that they were willing to leave the property if given reasonable notice and provided suitable alternative land to which they could move. \n\n<p>They were told they could move to a place referred to as Walmer Township and they rejected the proposal saying the area was crime-ridden and over-crowded and further that they feared they would have no security of occupation there and find themselves liable to further eviction. The municipality argued that if alternative land was made available to them, they would be disrupting the housing programme and forcing the municipality to grant them preferential treatment.</p>\n\n<p>The applicant sought for leave to appeal against the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal to have the eviction order against the respondent restored. The court had to determine whether the decision of the SCA to set aside the eviction order should be overturned. It held that when dealing with constitutionally protected rights, it is important to uphold the values of human dignity, equality and freedom. One of the provisions of the Bill of Rights that has to be interpreted with these values in mind, is section 25, which provides for the right to property. This matter accordingly turns on establishing an appropriate constitutional relationship between section 25 and section 26. The court held that the provisions of section 25 (4) and (5) must be borne in mind whenever section 25 was being construed, this is because they emphasised that under the Constitution, the protection of property as an individual right was not absolute but subject to societal considerations.</p>\n\nThe Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act cannot simply be looked at as a legislative mechanism to re-establish common law property rights and it should not be seen as a means of promoting legal compassion in favour of the poor.  \nIn making its decision, the court must consider all relevant circumstances, including the manner in which occupation was effected, its duration and the availability of suitable alternative accommodation or land and as such it held that the application for leave to appeal was denied.\n",

      "decision": "The Court, in a unanimous decision held that considering the period which the occupiers have lived on the land, the fact that eviction is not necessary for the land to be put to productive use and that this is a relatively small group of people who appear to be genuinely homeless and in need, it would not be just and equitable to order the eviction. It found that the state has a duty to satisfy both property and housing rights provided for in sections 25 and 26 of the Constitution. The application for leave to appeal was dismissed with costs.",

      "summary": "It is important to note that the matter heard by the Constitutional Court in fact related to two matters (the Ferreira referral and the Vryenhoek referral) but as the issues raised were identical the Constitutional Court heard it together. The Constitutional Court only had to determine the constitutionality of certain provisions of s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973, concerning the summoning of persons during the winding-up provisions of two companies. The facts relavnt to this matter is that in both matters the applicants were summoned for examination in terms of s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 in the winding-up process of two companies. In both cases the applicants objected to being compelled to answer questions put to them that might tend to incriminate them and they applied to the Witwatersrand Local Division of the Supreme Court for a temporary interdict against the respondents, prohibiting further interrogation pending the determination of the constitutionality of s 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act. The Witwatersrand Local Division of the Supreme Court also heard the two matters together and referred the constitutional challenge to the Constitutional Court.\n\n<p>The Constitutional Court essentially had to determine the constitutionality of certain provisions of s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973, relating to the examination of persons in the winding-up process of companies. The applicants (as they were referred to in the two referral cases) objected to being compelled to answer questions put to them which might tend to incriminate them. The applicants held that any answer given might be used in evidence against them in subsequent criminal proceedings, infringing on their <b>section 25(3)</b> constitutional right to a fair criminal trial (in terms of the then Interim Constitution \u2013 similar provision in <b>section 35(1)(c) of the Constitution</b>). The applicants held that the right against self-incrimination is not limited to detained, arrested or accused persons (as per s 25 of the Interim Constitution) but also extends to \u201cextra-curial proceedings\u201d including proceedings in terms of s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973. The infringement of various other constitutional rights including the right to freedom and security of the person and personal privacy in ss 11 and 13 of the Interim Constitution respectively were  also argued in the alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority judgment written by Ackerman J, held that in order to rely on s 25(3) of the Constitution there must \u201cbe an infringement or threat\u201d to the right and the s 25(3) rights only accrue an \u201caccused person\u201d in a criminal trial. The threat only arises once a person who tendered evidence in a section 417 enquiry is accused in a criminal trial and that evidence tendered is specifically used.  Therefore s 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 was not held to constitute an infringement on any section 25(3) rights and the majority dismissed this challenge. Justice Ackerman then considered the alternative main argument that s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 infringed ss 11 and 13 of the Interim Constitution. On this analysis Ackerman J held that this analysis required two stages. One first has to determine whether there was   an infringement off ss 11 and 13 of the Constitution. If there was an infringement then one has to analyse whether this infringement may be justified under <b>s 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> (the limitation clause \u2013 now <b>section 36 of the Constitution</b>). On this analysis Ackerman J, held that s 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act unduly infringed on s 11(1) of the Interim Constitution and declared it invalid only to the extent that answers given at such an enquiry may be used against such a person in criminal proceedings against the person. </p>",

      "decision": "It is firstly important to note that this matter was heard in terms of the Interim Constitution. <b>Section 36 of the Constitution</b> (the limitation of rights provision) was found in section 33 of the Interim Constitution. It is important to note that this judgment confirmed that the limitation of rights concerns two stages. The first stage involves a consideration of the scope of the constitutional right and the challenged law. Ackerman J writing for the majority analysed whether section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act 633 of 1971 firstly limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>, relating to the right to freedom and security of the person. Ackerman J emphasised that a broad interpretation should be given at this stage of the entrenched right as the second stage of the limitation test involving <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> prescribes the criteria that has to be met before an entrenched right can be limited. Ackerman held that s 417(2)(b) limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> and then turned to the second stage of the limitation test. The second stage involved analysing whether this limitation could be justified as reasonable in a democratic society taking into account the prescribed factors in <b>section 33 (1) of the Interim Constitution</b>. Ackerman J, importantly emphasised in this matter that the onus is on the party relying on the legislation to justify the limitation in terms of <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> and not for the party challenging it. On applying the second stage of the limitation test, Ackerman J held that section 417(2)(b) unduly infringed on <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>.",
      "dissent": "The dissenting judgment was written by Kriegler J. Although Kriegler J agreed with the majority judgments that the rights in terms of <b>section 25(3) of the Interim Constitution</b> does not extend to witnesses at a section 417 enquiry, he disagreed that <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> applied to this case. Kriegler J essentially raised concerns on the timing of the matter and held that access to the Constitutional Court in terms of section 100(2) of the Constitution and Rule 17 of the Constitutional Rules was not justified by the applicants. The applicants only had a \u201chypothetical fears\u201d that the evidence given at such an enquiry may be used in a subsequent criminal proceeding. The matter would only have been ripe in the event that the applicants were challenged at a criminal trial with the evidence they have given and then only could they have resorted to their <b>section 25(3)</b> constitutional rights.",

In 1997, the second applicant, was taken from her biological parents whilst in the maternity ward at a hospital. In 2015 when the applicant was 17 years old, she was found by her biological parents.

The court found that limitations arising from a failure to provide ongoing protection were not justified. The purpose of freedom of expression and open justice were compelling, but when it came to the balancing of these competing rights, the best interests of children, the right to dignity and privacy outweighed the barrier to the principle of open justice.

The dissenting Justices held further that the conclusion that the rights to dignity, privacy and the best interests of the child were infringed was hard to understand in the context of the ongoing protection. This was because the issue was that section 154(3) failed to protect children when they turn 18 years of age hence the fear that the media were going to publish the first applicant\u2019s identity when she turned 18.

The protection of property against unconstitutional interreference is also directly reflected in international conventions, which South Africa has to adhere to such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
