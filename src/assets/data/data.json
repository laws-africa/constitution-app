The University\u2019s previous policy, adopted in 2014, established English and Afrikaans as languages of instruction (with interpretation). Compared to the 2016 Policy, the 2014 Policy would have cost an additional R640 million in infrastructure, plus about R78 million per year thereafter, entailing a 20% increase in fees (R8100 on top of the approximately R40 000 per year per student). The 2016 Policy makes teaching primarily English: teaching is in both English and Afrikaans \u2018where reasonably practicable and pedagogically sound\u2019 (parallel medium); and where demand is insufficient and recourses do not permit, only Afrikaans translations are provided, coupled with questions and answers in Afrikaans (as opposed to real-time interpreting). At the time of the judgment, Afrikaans was still offered on large scale at undergraduate level; all first-year lectures continue to be offered in Afrikaans; any student could be taught in English.\n\n<p>Following an extensive and exhaustive process, and in the wake of Fees Must Fall and Open Stellenbosch upheavals on its campus in 2015, the University of Stellenbosch adopted a new language policy in 2016 under the Higher Education Act and the National Language Policy for Higher Education (LPHE) to replace its 2014 policy which would have cost the University millions more Rands in infrastructure and annual operational costs, resulting in fee increases. The 2016 Policy makes teaching primarily English: teaching is in both English and Afrikaans; and where demand is insufficient and recourses do not permit, only Afrikaans translations are provided, coupled with questions and answers in Afrikaans. </p>\n\n<p>The Court upheld the 2016 Policy which was challenged under both section 29(2) and section 6 of the Constitution, ruling that it validly replaced the 2014 Policy which was not reasonably practicable as determined by the University.</p>\n\n<p>The Court ruled, in respect of the section 6 challenge, that Afrikaans did not suffer \u2018historically diminished use and status\u2019 and therefore not qualify as a disadvantaged indigenous language in terms of section 6(2), even though it did qualify as indigenous; it only qualifies and is protected as an official language under <b>section 6(4)</b>.</p> \n\n<p>The state has a much wider margin under <b>section 6(4)</b> than under <b>section 6(2)</b>. Under <b>section 6(2)</b>, the state is obliged to advance historically diminished languages through \u2018practical and positive measures\u2019 without disregarding the official languages under <b>section 6(4)</b>. However, under <b>section 6(4)</b>, the state is only required to treat the official languages listed equitably by not diminishing them. This means that the state cannot disregard the official languages and is obliged to conserve them, but not at the expense of corrective, advancement measures under section 6(2).</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Court acknowledged that whilst the world was growing more hostile to minority languages, it was not the University\u2019s burden to prevent the decline of Afrikaans across South African tertiary institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Moegoeng CJ concurred separately, emphasizing emphasized the need to develop all indigenous languages including the spoken languages of the First Nation people.

A learner, taking part in a voluntary (non-compulsory) cultural and religious practice, pierced her nose and returned to school after the holidays wearing a nose stud, in contravention of the School Code of Conduct. After consultation between the parties, and between the School and experts, the School ultimately refused to allow her to continue wearing the nose stud and sought to enforce its Code of Conduct against her through conducting a disciplinary hearing. The refusal and scheduling of a disciplinary hearing prompted Ms V Pillay (the Respondent) to launch proceedings in the Equality Court.\n\n<p>A School Code of Conduct banned the wearing of jewellery (at school), except for plain stud earrings and wrist watches. The ban extended to any other piercings, including nose studs.

The Constitutional Court found that the refusal amounted to a violation of those rights; and that schools must reasonably accommodate differences and diversity in their communities. The Court found that it was legitimate (in general) for schools to promote uniformity in aiming to establish a disciplined school environment, but that exceptions (reasonable accommodations) must be allowed where demanded by the Constitution \u2013 as determined through a balancing of rights and interests. The Court ordered the School to amend its Code of Conduct to provide for exemption procedures allowing learners, on genuine cultural or religious grounds, to apply for permission to deviate from the uniform and other standards and requirements of the Code of Conduct, thereby allowing for the rights and interests to be weighed and balanced in the specific circumstances on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n\n<p>The Court noted that whilst uniforms and school rules serve an important purpose in education, the case was not about uniforms in general, but about a specific exemption to a uniform.

His argument lay in the fact that the Public Protector was not a judge and could not be afforded the same power to have binding remedial actions.\n\n<p>The Public Protector (third respondent) in terms of her powers investigated allegations of improper conduct and irregular expenditure regarding the security upgrades done to the private residence of the second respondent. After conducting her investigation, the Public Protector concluded that the second respondent had acted contrary to the Constitution because he had knowingly benefited from the irregular expenditure of State resources. The Public Protector then directed that the second respondent pay back the portion of the undue benefit that had benefitted him and his family. In addition to this, the Public Protector directed that the second respondent would have to reprimand the Ministers that were involved in the project for acting inappropriately.</p>\n\n<p>The Court emphasised that the office of the Public Protector was created to strengthen democracy and as such, it is impartial and subject only to the Constitution and the law. The Public Protector derived its powers from the Constitution primarily and the Public Protector Act did not take away nor did it substitute any of the powers vested in the Public Protector by the Constitution. Instead, the Public Protector Act enhanced the powers afforded to the Public Protector under the Constitution. Making recommendations that may be disregarded was held by the court to be inconsistent with ss 11 and 182 of the Constitution which govern the Public Protector. The court held that there was a safeguard to the remedial powers of the Public Protector because the remedial actions decided by the Public Protector were open to being challenged in court. Lastly, not all remedial actions would be binding but the context of the case would determine the legal status of the remedial action.</p>\n\n<p>The primary source of the power to take remedial action was the Constitution and the Public Protector Act was a secondary source. This remedial power can only be exercised against people that the Public Protector is by law allowed to investigate. The Public Protector is empowered to decide on the appropriate remedial action to be taken and how the action must be implemented. Context, nature, and language would be used to determine whether remedial action is binding or not.</p>\n\n<p>The main dissenting views in the case were regarding the legal status of the remedial powers that lay with the Public Protector.  The second respondent argued that compliance with the Public Protectors remedial action was optional. The remedial action was never intended to be binding on the person being investigated as the Public Protector was not a judicial officer. It was also argued that the Public Protector Act watered down the powers of the Public Protector in particular the remedial powers. On the other hand, it was argued that in the case of the Public Protector handing down an unfavourable remedial action, the person investigated had no option but to comply with the action.

It is also important to note that in the process, the Constitutional Court heard various submissions on the final constitutional text by political parties and other civil bodies and as elaborated further below the Constitutional Court found that the draft constitutional text did not comply in all aspects with the constitutional principles and referred it back to the Constitutional Assembly.</p>\n\n<p>The  Constitutional Court, was tasked with certifying the final constitutional text and the Court had to determine whether the constitutional text complied with the 34 constitutional principles in Schedule 4 of the Interim Constitution. The Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment was divided in eight chapters, ranging from the context of the certification process, the interpretation of the constitutional principles to the application and interpretation of the Bill of Rights and provincial and local Government powers.</p>\n\n<p>There were certain serious concerns raised by the Constitutional Court in measuring the final text against the constitutional principles. One of the concerns involved the safeguarding and protection of the independence of the Public-Protector and the Auditor-General which did not comply with Constitutional Principle CP XXIX, relating to the independence of the Public Service Commission, the Reserve Bank, an Auditor General and a Public Protector. The Constitutional Court also emphasised that the independence and impartiality of the Public Protector is critical to ensuring an accountable and effective government. As stated above the constitutional text was referred back to the Constitutional Assembly for further amendments.</p>\n\n<p>In the Constitution, <b>section 1</b> refers to the founding values of the Constitution. These values emphasise that the Republic of South Africa is \u201cone, sovereign, democratic state\u201d which is founded on various core value such as human dignity, non-racialism, supremacy of the Constitution and a multi-party system of democratic governance. It is perhaps critical before briefly summarising the Constitutional Court\u2019s views on these values in the judgment to highlight that these founding values form the foundation of our constitutional order and in terms of the Constitution numerous requirements need to be met to amend these provisions.</p>\n\n<p>Turning to the Constitutional Court judgment, the Court emphasised that it is necessary to identify the basic structures of our new constitutional order and it was the first question the Court was faced with on certifying the final constitutional text against the <b>34 constitutional principles</b>.

The applicants had signed contracts for the two children with the respondent. In these contracts was a clause that allowed the respondent to cancel the contract at any time, for any reason as long as a full term\u2019s written notice was given. \n\n<p>After a series of incidents where the applicants behaved inappropriately in front of young children, the respondent terminated the applicants\u2019 contracts with a written full-term notice. The applicants then proceeded to approach the High Court for an interim order whilst they sought to have the termination of their contract with the respondent cancelled.</p>\n\n<p>The issue was whether the clause in the contract was a Constitutionally valid one as it did not afford the other party to the contract to state their case before the contract was terminated. \nSecondly, whether independent schools had constitutional duties and obligations that limited their exercise of contractual rights.</p>\n\n<p>The court found that <b>section 8 of the Constitution</b> allowed for the development of the common law to hold independent schools as providing basic education.</p> \n\n<p>That the clause was unconstitutional, went against public policy and was unenforceable because there was no fair procedure followed in the case. It was found that once an independent school provided basic education then it was required of that school to ensure that the education of the children attending the school were not affected. The argument that only the state provides basic education and not independent schools was based on incorrect pre-constitutional common law principles that cannot stand in light of the Constitution. The common law was developed under <b>section 8(3)(a)</b> to hold independent schools of providing basic education.</p>\n\n<p>The court considered whether it was constitutionally valid for independent private schools to expel children without following fair processes. The court held that clause 9.3 of the school\u2019s parent contract is unconstitutional and therefore invalid because the clause does not give an  opportunity for fair processes to the learners or their parents/guardian or representatives to make representations before a decision is made by the school to terminate the parent contract and remove the child from the school. The court held that <b>section 29 of the Constitution</b> places an obligation on all schools, both private and government schools to not impair or interfere with the right to basic education. In this case, the school was unable to demonstrate appropriate reasons for limiting the rights of the applicants to basic education without providing an opportunity to the applicants to make representations to the school before the decision to remove the children from the school had taken place.  The court therefore held that the <b>section 29</b> was impaired and concluded that the school had the obligation to consider the rights of the applicants children to have their views heard on the matter and to offer this opportunity to them, either in person or through a representative. Therefore the clause is unconstitutional and invalid.</p>\n\n<p>There were five different judgements that all agreed with the fact that the clause was constitutionally invalid because it went against not only public policy but the Constitution.

The respondent was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. In 1997 he however applied for amnesty under the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 and was granted it in 2001. In 2003 the respondent was a candidate to head the Ekurhuleni metro police. The appellant in September and October 2003 published various articles and editorials questioning the respondent\u2019s candidacy and expressed the view that he was a \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cmurdered\u201d. Some of the articles failed to mention that the respondent was granted amnesty by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the respondent sued the appellant and other journalists for defamation in the Witwatersrand Local Division (South Gauteng High Court), arguing that the articles were malicious as he was granted amnesty. The respondent was successful in the High Court with the defamation claim and the appellants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court of Appeal only partially upheld the appeal and reduced the amount of damages awarded to the respondent. The appellants then appealed to the constitutional Court against the Supreme Court of Appeal judgment and the respondent cross-appealed the reduction in damages awarded by the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n\n<p>The key issue the Constitutional Court had to determine was how amnesty granted to the respondent for crimes committed (during the struggle against apartheid) by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission affected a claim for defamation. The respondent was granted amnesty in terms of the <b>Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995</b> for crimes committed in 1986. In 2003 the appellants in various commentary covering the candidacy of the respondent for the position of head of the Erkhuleni Metro police referred to the respondent as a \u201cmurderer\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d. Justice Cameron writing for the majority geld that the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 did not make the fact that the respondent committed murder untrue and the Act did not prohibit frank public discussion. Justice Cameron emphasised that the requirement that a comment must be \u201dfair\u201d  protects criticism even if it is extreme so long it is without malice, on a matter of public interest and  on facts that are true. The Constitutional Court therefore upheld the appellant\u2019s main appeal and dismissed the respondent\u2019s cross appeal but the Court did find that the appellant had defamed the respondent by claiming falsely that he was not contrite and awarded the respondent damages on this aspect.</p>\n\n<p>As the matter essentially concerned a defamation claim and the defences raised thereto a key issue the Constitutional Court had to decide was, how to find a balance between two constitutional rights, namely the appellant\u2019s right to freedom of expression on the one hand and the respondent\u2019s right to human dignity. Justice Cameron writing for the majority, emphasised that the right to human dignity is not only given separate constitutional recognition in s 10 of the Constitution but is also one of the founding values of the society terms of s 1. Therefore, a failure to uphold the right is not only a violation of section 10 but is also a threat to a founding value underpinning the legitimacy of the State. However importantly Cameron J, pointed out that freedom of expression is just as important as human dignity and one cannot say that human dignity trumps freedom of expression. The law of defamation importantly must be interpreted to give effect to the appropriate balance between the right to freedom of expression on the one hand and a person\u2019s human dignity on the other hand. Cameron J held on this interpretation that the requirement that a comment must be \u201cfair\u201d in defence to a claim for defamation gives effect to the balance between the right to freedom of expression and dignity.</p>\n\n<p>Partial dissenting judgments were written by Ngcobo J and Mogoeng J. Justice Ngcobo agreed with the majority judgment that the <b>Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995</b> did not make the facts of the commission of the murders untrue but Ngcobo J held that the balancing of the right to freedom and the right to dignity  required the facts upon which the appellant relied in their comment to include the fact that the respondent was granted amnesty by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission. However, on reading the coverage of the respondent\u2019s candidacy collectively Ngcobo J found that this fact was adequately stated. Justice Ngcobo however held that since the appellant failed to make reference to the circumstances under which the appellant was released from detention in Mozambique the statement of the appellant concerning gun-running allegations in Mozambique was based on \u201chalf-truths\u201d and therefore was untrue, justifying the respondent\u2019s cross appeal. Justice Mogoeng in his judgment specifically held that the defamatory statements that the respondent was a \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cmurder \u201cmust be determined within the context of the objective of the amnesty process and that the truth told during the amnesty process was not meant to be used in a manner that defeats the purpose of national reconciliation. Justice Mogoeng held that the defamatory statements that the respondent was a \u201cmurderer\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d was malicious and was contrary to the pursuit of national reconciliation.</p> ", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "", "dissent": "", "citedCases": ["Albutt v Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation and Others 2010 (3) SA 293 (CC)", "Azanian Peoples Organisation (AZAPO) and Others v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others 1996 (4) SA 671 (CC)", "Bhe and Others v Magistrate, Khayelitsha, and Others (Commission for Gender Equality, as amicus curiae); Shibi v Sithole and Others; South African Human Rights Commission and Another v President of the Republic of South Africa and Another 2005 (1) SA 580 (CC)", "Br\u00fcmmer v Minister for Social Development and Others 2009 (6) SA 323 (CC)", "Dawood and Another v Minister of Home Affairs and Others; Shalabi and Another v Minister of Home Affairs and Others; Thomas and Another v Minister of Affairs and Others 2000 (8) BCLR 837 (CC)", "Dikoko v Mokhatla 2007 (1) BCLR 1 (CC)", "Doctors for Life International v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others 2006 (6) SA 416 (CC)", "Du Toit v Minister for Safety and Security and Another 2009 (12) BCLR 1171 (CC)", "Government of the Republic of South Africa and Others v Grootboom and Others 2001 (1) SA 46 (CC)", "Islamic Unity Convention v Independent Broadcasting Authority and Others  2002 (4) SA 294 (CC)", "Khumalo and Others v Holomisa 2002 (5) SA 401 (CC)", "Le Roux and Others v Dey [2011] ZACC 4", "Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development v Chonco and Others 2010 (4) SA 82 (CC)", "National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality and Another v Minister of Justice and Others 1998 (12) BCLR 1517 (CC)", "President of the Republic of South Africa and Another v Hugo 1997 (6) BCLR 708 (CC)", "S v Mamabolo (E TV and Others, intervening) 2001 (5) BCLR 449 (CC)", "Shalabi and Another v Minister of Home Affairs and Others; Thomas and Another v Minister of Home Affairs and Others [2000] ZACC 8; 2000 (3) SA 936 (CC)", "South African Broadcasting Corp Ltd v National Director of Public Prosecutions and Others 2007 (1) SA 523 (CC)\n "]}, {"id": "PortElizabethMunicipalityvVariousOccupiers", "href": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2004/7.html\r\r", "title": "Port Elizabeth Municipality v Various Occupiers\r\n\r", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2004-10-01T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_25__Property_Rights"], "justicesConcurring": "Sachs J (Chaskalson CJ, Langa DCJ, Madala J, Mokgoro J, Moseneke J, Ngcobo J; O\u2019Regan J, Skweyiya J, Van der Westhuizen J and Yacoob J concurring)", "summary": "The Port Elizabeth Municipality required an eviction order against 68 people who erected and occupied 29 shacks on privately owned land within the municipality.

They indicated that they were willing to leave the property if given reasonable notice and provided suitable alternative land to which they could move. \n\n<p>They were told they could move to a place referred to as Walmer Township and they rejected the proposal saying the area was crime-ridden and over-crowded and further that they feared they would have no security of occupation there and find themselves liable to further eviction.

The court had to determine whether the decision of the SCA to set aside the eviction order should be overturned. It held that when dealing with constitutionally protected rights, it is important to uphold the values of human dignity, equality and freedom. One of the provisions of the Bill of Rights that has to be interpreted with these values in mind, is <b>section 25</b>, which provides for the right to property. This matter accordingly turns on establishing an appropriate constitutional relationship between <b>section 25</b> and <b>section 26</b>. The court held that the provisions of <b>section 25 (4) and (5)</b> must be borne in mind whenever <b>section 25</b> was being construed, this is because they emphasised that under the Constitution, the protection of property as an individual right was not absolute but subject to societal considerations.</p>\n\n<p>The Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act cannot simply be looked at as a legislative mechanism to re-establish common law property rights and it should not be seen as a means of promoting legal compassion in favour of the poor.

The issue before the court was whether Parliament had the authority to transfer its powers vested upon it by the Constitution to the executive arm of government.

The application was postponed for argument and thereafter the presiding officer who was not a magistrate, issued a warrant committing the applicant to prison. The court held that the matter was one that had to be to be determined through the application of the doctrine of separation of powers because section 66(3) of the Insolvency Act gave authority to appointees who happen not to be judicial officers to send recalcitrant witnesses to jail.\n\n\n<p>The appellant made an application for confirmation of an order made by the Cape of Good Hope High Court on the constitutional invalidity of section 66(3) of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936 which authorized a person presiding over a creditors' meeting to imprison an unruly witness. The issue before the court was whether a presiding officer who was not a magistrate should have the power to commit to prison a recalcitrant witness as provided for in section 66(3) of the Insolvency Act. The Court decided that the High Court order was only confirmed to the extent that section 66(3) of the Insolvency Act was unconstitutional in so far as it authorized a presiding officer who was not a magistrate to commit a disobedinet witness to prison. As such, the provisions of section 66(3) were only unconstitutional were they empowered a presiding officer who was not a magistrate to commit an uncooperative witness to imprisonment as these were the powers of judicial officers. The court ruled that only judicial officers may, consistent with the proper separation of government powers, commit recalcitrant witnesses to prison. The court said that the power to commit an uncooperative witness to prison was within the very core of constitutional judicial power and therefore could not be exercised by non-judicial officers. </p>\n\n\n<p>In majority, the court concluded that the power to commit disobedient witnesses at insolvency hearings served an important public objective which was to ensure that insolvents and other persons who are in a position to give important information relating to an insolvency did not avoid providing it. It held that an uncooperative witness at an insolvency enquiry was not an accused person and did not amount to a recalcitrant witness under the Criminal Procedure Act therefore, they did not have the right under section 35(3) of the Constitution to claim a trial before an ordinary court.</p>\n\n<p>The court ruled in majority that considering that the first respondent was a magistrate, it was not unconstitutional for a magistrate to issue a warrant of committal under section 66(3). It ruled further that the order of invalidity made by the High Court was confirmed only to the extent that section 66(3), read with section 39(2) of the Insolvency Act  24 of 1936, was unconstitutional where it authorised a presiding officer who was not a magistrate to issue a warrant committing to prison a witness at a creditors meeting held under section 65 of the Insolvency Act.</p>\n\n<p> The court held that section 66(3) was not inconsistent with any fair procedure right protected by <b>section 12(1) of the Constitution</b>. However, the court found that the committal provision of section 66(3), read with section 39(2) of the Insolvency Act, infringed <b>section 12(1)(b) of the 1996 Constitution</b> only to the extent that a person who is not a magistrate is authorised by the subsection to issue a warrant committing to prison an examinee at a creditors meeting held under section 65 of the Insolvency Act. </p>\n\n<p>In its dissent, the court disagreed with the majority court decision that section 66(3) of the Insolvency act would be invalid where it empowered a presiding officer who was not a magistrate to issue a warrant of committal to prison.

The Constitutional Court only had to determine the constitutionality of certain provisions of s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973, concerning the summoning of persons during the winding-up provisions of two companies. The facts relavnt to this matter is that in both matters the applicants were summoned for examination in terms of s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 in the winding-up process of two companies. In both cases the applicants objected to being compelled to answer questions put to them that might tend to incriminate them and they applied to the Witwatersrand Local Division of the Supreme Court for a temporary interdict against the respondents, prohibiting further interrogation pending the determination of the constitutionality of s 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act. The Witwatersrand Local Division of the Supreme Court also heard the two matters together and referred the constitutional challenge to the Constitutional Court.\n\n<p>The Constitutional Court essentially had to determine the constitutionality of certain provisions of s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973, relating to the examination of persons in the winding-up process of companies. The applicants (as they were referred to in the two referral cases) objected to being compelled to answer questions put to them which might tend to incriminate them. The applicants held that any answer given might be used in evidence against them in subsequent criminal proceedings, infringing on their <b>section 25(3)</b> constitutional right to a fair criminal trial (in terms of the then Interim Constitution \u2013 similar provision in <b>section 35(1)(c) of the Constitution</b>). The applicants held that the right against self-incrimination is not limited to detained, arrested or accused persons (as per s 25 of the Interim Constitution) but also extends to \u201cextra-curial proceedings\u201d including proceedings in terms of s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973. The infringement of various other constitutional rights including the right to freedom and security of the person and personal privacy in ss 11 and 13 of the Interim Constitution respectively were  also argued in the alternative.</p>\n\n<p>The majority judgment written by Ackerman J, held that in order to rely on s 25(3) of the Constitution there must \u201cbe an infringement or threat\u201d to the right and the s 25(3) rights only accrue an \u201caccused person\u201d in a criminal trial. The threat only arises once a person who tendered evidence in a section 417 enquiry is accused in a criminal trial and that evidence tendered is specifically used.  Therefore s 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 was not held to constitute an infringement on any section 25(3) rights and the majority dismissed this challenge. Justice Ackerman then considered the alternative main argument that s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 infringed ss 11 and 13 of the Interim Constitution. On this analysis Ackerman J held that this analysis required two stages. One first has to determine whether there was   an infringement off ss 11 and 13 of the Constitution. If there was an infringement then one has to analyse whether this infringement may be justified under <b>s 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> (the limitation clause \u2013 now <b>section 36 of the Constitution</b>). On this analysis Ackerman J, held that s 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act unduly infringed on s 11(1) of the Interim Constitution and declared it invalid only to the extent that answers given at such an enquiry may be used against such a person in criminal proceedings against the person. </p>\n\n<p>It is firstly important to note that this matter was heard in terms of the Interim Constitution. <b>Section 36 of the Constitution</b> (the limitation of rights provision) was found in section 33 of the Interim Constitution. It is important to note that this judgment confirmed that the limitation of rights concerns two stages. The first stage involves a consideration of the scope of the constitutional right and the challenged law. Ackerman J writing for the majority analysed whether section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act 633 of 1971 firstly limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>, relating to the right to freedom and security of the person. Ackerman J emphasised that a broad interpretation should be given at this stage of the entrenched right as the second stage of the limitation test involving <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> prescribes the criteria that has to be met before an entrenched right can be limited. Ackerman held that s 417(2)(b) limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> and then turned to the second stage of the limitation test. The second stage involved analysing whether this limitation could be justified as reasonable in a democratic society taking into account the prescribed factors in <b>section 33 (1) of the Interim Constitution</b>. Ackerman J, importantly emphasised in this matter that the onus is on the party relying on the legislation to justify the limitation in terms of <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> and not for the party challenging it. On applying the second stage of the limitation test, Ackerman J held that section 417(2)(b) unduly infringed on <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>.</p>\n\n<p>The dissenting judgment was written by Kriegler J. Although Kriegler J agreed with the majority judgments that the rights in terms of <b>section 25(3) of the Interim Constitution</b> does not extend to witnesses at a section 417 enquiry, he disagreed that <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> applied to this case. Kriegler J essentially raised concerns on the timing of the matter and held that access to the Constitutional Court in terms of section 100(2) of the Constitution and Rule 17 of the Constitutional Rules was not justified by the applicants. The applicants only had a \u201chypothetical fears\u201d that the evidence given at such an enquiry may be used in a subsequent criminal proceeding. The matter would only have been ripe in the event that the applicants were challenged at a criminal trial with the evidence they have given and then only could they have resorted to their <b>section 25(3)</b> constitutional rights.</p>", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "", "dissent": "", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "DanielsvScribanteandAnother", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2020/12.html", "title": "Daniels v Scribante and Another", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2017-05-11T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_8__Application"], "justicesConcurring": "Mogoeng CJ, Moseneke DCJ, Bosielo J, Cameron J, Froneman J, Jafta J, Khampepe J, Madlanga J, Mhlantla J, Nkabinde J, and Zondo J.

Concerned by the media attention, the second applicant approached the first applicant, the Centre for Child Law, for legal support. The Centre for Child Law wrote to all major media houses and requested that they don\u2019t reveal the first applicant\u2019s identity.\n\n<p>The applicants requested a declaration that section 154(3) should protect the anonymity of child victims of crime when properly interpreted. The media respondents asserted that the two extensions of section 154(3) are constitutionally impermissible, as they are in conflict with the rights to freedom of expression and the principle of open justice. The issue before the court was that section 154(3) expressly provided anonymity protection for child accused or witnesses in criminal proceedings, however, the protection did not extend to child victims. The court also had to determine whether the protection afforded by section 154(3) should extend into adulthood for child accused, witnesses and victims.</p>\n\n<p>The court held that the predominant purpose of section 154(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act was child protection. Protection from the potentially harmful effects of the publication of their names and identities as a result of being implicated in criminal proceedings. Since this protection is only afforded to child accused and witnesses, there was a gap in the law as it pertained to protecting child victims in criminal proceedings. The court held that the exclusion of child victims in section 154(3) limited the right to equality, as it constituted a one-sided differentiation that did not offer equal protection and benefit of the law. The court found that rights of children, their dignity and privacy were inherently linked, as each child had their own \u201cindividual dignity, special needs and interests\u201d. To not have control over how some of the most traumatic and intimate moments of a child\u2019s life are shared with the public attacked the very core of the child\u2019s dignity.</p>\n\n<p>The court found that the right to dignity limited the reach of the right to freedom of expression, which is guaranteed by <b>section 16 of the Constitution</b> and included <b>the right of the media to publish information</b>. The right to publish information was not to be used to justify the breach of the right to dignity. The court found that limitations arising from a failure to provide ongoing protection were not justified. The purpose of freedom of expression and open justice were compelling, but when it came to the balancing of these competing rights, the best interests of children, the right to dignity and privacy outweighed the barrier to the principle of open justice. The serious harms caused to child participants, overshadow the minimal harm to open justice. The granting of the default ongoing protection would not present a harsh interference into media freedom. </p>\n\n<p>The court held that the best interest of the child principle combined with the rights to dignity and privacy warrant ongoing protection for child participants into adulthood. The majority judgment states that there are different but warranted justifications for ongoing protection afforded to child victims, witnesses and accused. The court acknowledged the open justice principle and the importance of freedom of expression, however held that the default position of offering the child participants ongoing protection did not result in a severe disadvantage on media freedom. Court declared <b>section 154(3)</b> invalid and ordered an interim reading-in which requires that a person who is subject to the protection of the section does not forfeit the protections upon reaching adulthood, and is entitled to consent to the publication of their identity after reaching adulthood, or if consent is refused, a competent court may be approach by the media to request an upliftment of the publication ban.</p>\n\n<p>Cameron J, Froneman J and Jafta J agreed with the majority decision on the issue of victim protection but differed on the issue relating to ongoing protection. The court held that the right to freedom of expression and the principle of open justice tipped the scales in favour of a default regime in which anonymity protection ended when a child participant reaches 18 years, unless a court expressly extends the protection. The dissenting Justices held further that the conclusion that the rights to dignity, privacy and the best interests of the child were infringed was hard to understand in the context of the ongoing protection. This was because the issue was that <b>section 154(3)</b> failed to protect children when they turn 18 years of age hence the fear that the media were going to publish the first applicant\u2019s identity when she turned 18. Otherwise before that she had been adequately protected by the section.</p>", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "", "dissent": "", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "UnionofRefugeeWomenandOthersvDirectorPrivateSecurityIndustryRegulatoryAuthorityandOthers", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2006/23.html", "title": "\nUnion of Refugee Women and Others v Director, Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority and Others", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2006-06-12T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_12__Freedom_and_Security_of_the_Person"], "justicesConcurring": "Kondile AJ", "summary": "The applicants made an application regarding the rights of refugees to work in the private security industry in South Africa.

The right to equality was held not to be violated by section 23 of the Security Act. The court held that the private security industry was a special environment and at stake was the safety and security of the public at large. <b>Section 12 of the Constitution</b> provides everyone the right to freedom and security of the person, which included the right to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources. In a society damaged by violent crime, the importance of protecting this right could not be exaggerated.</p>\n\n<p>The court held that the regulatory scheme was carefully designed for the purpose of screening entrants to the private security industry rather than constituting a blanket ban on the registration of refugees as private security service providers. <b>Section 12 of the Constitution</b> provides everyone the right to freedom and security of the person, which included the right to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources. That is not to say that foreign nationals, including refugees, are inherently less trustworthy than South Africans. In a country where xenophobia has caused increased suffering, it is important to stress this and that it was not that the Authority did not trust refugees. The Security Act was designed to limit eligibility for registration to people whose trustworthiness could be objectively verified. The preamble to the Act acknowledges that the right to security of the person is fundamental to the well-being and to the social and economic development of every person.</p>\n\n<p>In their dissenting judgement, Mokgoro J and O'Regan J held that section 23(1)(a) of the Private Security Industry Regulation Act discriminated unfairly on the basis of refugee status. The court was not convinced that the purpose identified by the Minister to ensure that security service employees were trustworthy was really provided by the section. The dissenting judgment held that the order it would have proposed was to require that refugees who could meet the other requirements of the Act should not be barred from registration as security service providers. Those refugees who cannot meet those requirements should seek to establish that \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for them to be registered as contemplated by section 23(6).</p>\n", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "", "dissent": "", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "NMandOthersvSmithandOthersZACCSACCBCLRCC", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2007/6.html", "title": "\nNM and Others v Smith and Others [2007] ZACC 6; 2007 (5) SA 250 (CC); 2007 (7) BCLR 751 (CC)", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2007-04-04T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_14__Privacy"], "justicesConcurring": "\nMadala J, Moseneke DCJ, Mokgoro J, Skweyiya J, Van der Westhuizen J, Yacoob J, Sachs J, Langa J and O\u2019Regan J.", "summary": "The applicants who were HIV positive were involved in clinical trials.

The challenged laws were passed by Parliament, and on 27 January 2009 they were assented to and signed by the President. On 17 April 2009, the applicant challenged the constitutional validity of the impugned laws based on the absence of a rational basis for the enactment of the laws in question. The applicant also alleged that the process of enactment failed to comply with various constitutional obligations relating to accountability and upholding international obligations and allowing the NPA to properly exercise its functions. \n\n<p>The applicant made an application to determine the constitutional validity of the National Prosecuting Authority Amendment Act (NPAA Act) and the South African Police Service Amendment Act (SAPSA Act). The issue before the court was whether the national legislation that created the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, known as the Hawks (DPCI), and disbanded the Directorate of Special Operations, known as the Scorpions (DSO), is constitutionally valid. The court it held that the Constitution imposed an obligation on the state to establish and maintain an independent body to combat corruption and organised crime.

The reason behind the court\u2019s conclusion was that the DPCI was insufficiently protected from political influence in its structure and functioning.

They had approached a company known as SA Multiloan in Stellenbosch for small loans. Later when they fell into arrears, the creditor provider demanded that they sign further documents which resulted in default judgments and emoluments attachment orders obtained by the credit providers. This allowed for the deduction of the judgment debt from their salaries or wages.\n\n<p>As a result of this, all the applicants approached the Law Clinic to institute proceedings in the High Court to have section 65(J) declared unconstitutional. Their argument was that section 65(J) allowed for emoluments attachment orders to be obtained without judicial oversight. The High Court agreed with them and declared the section unconstitutional and therefore invalid. Application was then filed to the Constitutional Court to confirm invalidity of section 65(J).</p>\n\n\n<p>The majority judgment, written by Cameron J, disagreed with Jafta J\u2019s conclusion that it was possible to interpret section 65J as providing for judicial oversight. Section 65J(2) licenses the issuing of an emoluments attachment order where the debtor consents in writing; or if \u201cthe court has so authorised\u201d. The conjunction \u201cor\u201d seems to make plain that an emoluments attachment order may be obtained through the debtor\u2019s written consent even when the court has not authorised it. Additionally, section 65J(1) posits that a judgment creditor, not a court, causes an emoluments attachment order to be issued from a court. And once issued, section 65J(5) provides that the order may be executed \u201cas if it were a court judgment\u201d. This wording allows for execution without judicial oversight. The majority judgment therefore concluded that the plain language of the provision shows it permitted judicially unsanctioned enforcement of judgment debts. Therefore, the section was unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p>Zondo J concurred with the majority judgment but wrote separately. He took the view that in order for section 65J(1)(a) to be read to mean that it is the court that issues emoluments attachment orders, one would have to read the phrase <b>\u201cissued from the court\u201d</b> to mean <b>\u201cissued by the court\u201d</b>. Zondo J held that there is no room for this interpretation. </p>\n\n<p>The remedy adopted by Zondo J was supported by the majority. It was one of a combination of reading-in and severance and not the remedy adopted by the High Court. Accordingly, Zondo J did not confirm the order of constitutional invalidity made by the High Court, but rather ordered the reading-in, and severance of, certain words in section 65J(2)(a) and (b) in order to remedy the constitutional defect.</p>\n\n<p>The majority held that a debtor\u2019s <b>section 34 right of access to court</b> is breached when an execution process against any form of property occurs without judicial oversight of a court.</p>\n\n<p>Jafta J held that the High Court erred in proceeding from the premise that s65J(2) did not provide for judicial oversight without interpreting that section. He held that the Court was bound to determine for itself whether indeed the section failed to provide for judicial oversight.</p>\n\n<p>Jafta J held further that it should be determined whether the words \u201cfrom the court\u201d are capable of a meaning that accords with the assumed constitutional guarantee that, whenever execution is sought against one\u2019s property \u2013 regardless of whether movable or immovable \u2013 the execution must be subject to judicial oversight.</p>\n\n<p>Jafta J held that section 65J indeed provides for judicial supervision. Therefore, assuming that the Constitution requires judicial supervision when emoluments attachment orders are issued, the section meets the requirement. Jafta J added that in these circumstances he cannot confirm the order of invalidity made by the High Court.</p>\n", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "", "dissent": "", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "FedsureLifeAssuranceLtdandOthersvGreaterJohannesburgTransitionalMetropolitanCouncilandOthers", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1998/17.html ", "title": "Fedsure Life Assurance Ltd and Others v Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council and Others", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "1998-10-14T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_33__Just_Administrative_Action"], "justicesConcurring": "\nChaskalson P, Goldstone J and O\u2019Regan J (Ackermann J and Madala J)\n\nKriegler J (Langa DP, Mokgoro, Sachs J and Yacoob J)\n\n*The Court was unanimous in approach and interpretation of  \u2018administrative action\u2019.", "summary": "[Note: This case was decided under the <b>Interim Constitution</b>, but the decision remains relevant and applicable.]\n\n<p>[The Eastern Metropolitan Substructure, Western Metropolitan Substructure, Southern Metropolitan Substructure and the Northern Metropolitan Substructure were all transitional substructures of the Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council as at June 1996.]</p>\n\n<p>The metropolitan structures passed resolutions to substantially increase general rates on property and property rights within the Eastern and Northern Metropolitan Substructure areas, thereby generating surpluses in income from those areas to offset deficits in the budgets of the Western and Southern  Metropolitan Substructures and Greater Johannesburg  Transitional Metropolitan Council through subsidisation. </p>\n\n<p>The result was that ratepayers in some areas were required to pay increased property rates and others enjoyed a decrease in their rates.

(Legitimate, or reasonable, expectations are expectations arising from express promises or from regular practices which can reasonably be expected to continue.) </p>\n\n<p>(4) Noted that \u2018rights\u2019 under PAJA\u2019s definition might also include future rights (i.e. rights that have not yet vested or are not yet exercisable): provided that the action can impact on the future rights in that it has the capacity to affect them, the action might amount to administrative action and be challengeable under PAJA.<p>\n\n\n", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "", "dissent": "", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "BatoStarFishingPtyLtdvMinisterofEnvironmentalAffairsandTourismandOthers", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2004/15.html ", "title": "\nBato Star Fishing (Pty) Ltd v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism and Others", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2004-03-12T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_33__Just_Administrative_Action"], "justicesConcurring": "O\u2019Regan J (Chaskalson CJ, Langa DCJ, Ackermann J, Goldstone J, Madala J, Mokgoro J Moseneke J, Ngcobo J, Sachs J and Yacoob J)", "summary": "In context of the deep-sea hake trawl fishing sector, the applicant, Bato Star Fishing (Pty) Ltd, applied for an allowance of 12 000 tonnes in catch for the 2002-2005 fishing seasons.

Cameron AJ concluded that the substance of the Liquor Bill is directed at three objectives:</p>\n<p>(a) the prohibition on cross-holdings between the three tiers involved in the liquor trade, namely, producers, distributors and retailers;</p>\n<p>(b) the establishment of uniform conditions, in a single system, for the national registration of liquor manufacturers and distributors; and, in a further attempt at establishing national uniformity within the liquor trade;</p>\n<p>(c) the prescription of detailed mechanisms to provincial legislatures for the establishment of retail licensing mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p>The Court held that the Bill\u2019s prohibition of cross-holdings falls within the national legislature\u2019s competence to regulate trade. The national system of registration for producers and wholesalers may well also fall within the national legislature\u2019s competence to regulate trade, since the provinces\u2019 exclusive power in relation \"liquor licences\" was not in the first instance intended to encompass manufacturing and distribution of liquor since these activities are inter-provincial and international. The Court held that in any event national government had succeeded in showing that if the exclusive provincial competence regarding \"liquor licences\" extends to production and distribution, its interest in maintaining economic unity authorises it to intervene in these areas under <b>section 44(2)</b>.

The national Minister is empowered to transfer functions from a provincial administration or a provincial department to a national department or other body, or from a national body to a provincial body, after consultation with the MEC concerned.

The lawfulness and rationality requirements are minimum requirements applicable to all exercises of public power; if the minimum requirements are not met, then the exercise of the power is invalid.</p>\n\n<p>(3) Specifically, the Court determined that the President\u2019s decision \u2013 to bring the Act into operation through the proclamation \u2013 was irrational. The decision to bring the Act into force would have to have been for the purpose of making the Act an effective source of law; but without the schedules in place to classify the medical substances etc, the Act could not be implemented and was ineffective even if brought into operation. Therefore, the purpose for which the President exercised the power could not be achieved by the exercise of the power itself and was irrational.</p>\n", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "", "dissent": "", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "InreNationalEducationPolicyBillNoof", "href": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1996/3.html", "title": "In re: National Education Policy Bill No 83 of 1995\n", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "1996-04-03T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["Legislative_Process/_Competence"], "justicesConcurring": "Chaskalson P, Mahomed DP, Ackermann J, Didcott J, Kentridge AJ, Kriegler J, Langa J, Madala J, Mokgoro J, O\u2019Regan J, and Sachs J", "summary": "The Speaker of the National Assembly referred a dispute to the Constitutional Court regarding the constitutionality of certain provisions of <b>the National Education Bill</b>.

The applicant challenged the constitutional validity of section 6 of the Act and argued that the intended repeal of the Proclamation was beyond the legislative authority of the North West.

The Constitutional Court refused to confirm the order of invalidity made by the High Court, except insofar as it related to provisions concerning registration of title.

It emphasised that the main purpose of the Proclamation was to establish and administer racially and ethnically exclusive townships. Although section 6 provided for the establishment of deeds registries for the registration of deeds of grant and thus created certain land tenure rights, it had to be read within the framework of the whole of the Proclamation, which was mainly aimed at the administration and control of black people. The function of the Proclamation was to regulate land use as part of provincial planning, and this was within the provincial legislative competence.

It stipulated that a collective agreement was binding even on employees who were not members of the unions party to the agreement provided that those unions had the majority of the employees as their members in the workplace.  The court held that any infringement of the right to strike was reasonable and justifiable based on the principle of majoritarianism. The Court held that any infringement of the right to strike was reasonable and justifiable based on the principle of majoritarianism which, in this context, benefitted orderly collective bargaining. That majoritarianism was functional to enhanced collective bargaining was internationally recognized. The Court found that the conclusion of an agreement under <b>section 23(1)(d)</b> constituted the exercise of public power and was subject to review under the principle of legality. The principle required that all exercises of public power including non-administrative action follow minimum standards of lawfulness. For these reasons, the Court decided that the agreement validly extended to the applicant\u2019s members and the relevant statutory provisions were constitutionally consistent.</p>\n\n<p>The court in a unanimous decision held that the statutory structures that enforced the majoritarian system allowed minority unions freedom of association. Minority unions had recruiting rights which the applicant had as well as organisational and deduction rights. The court held further that the applicants had bargaining rights although they lost the right to strike while the agreement was in force. The court said none of the non-signatory unions or employees lost any of their organisational and collective bargaining entitlements. The court held that through affording these rights, this meant that the <b>LRA</b>, though premised on majoritarianism, was not a tool of oppression and did not supress minority unions. It held that the Act gave enough scope for minority unions to organise within the workforce and canvas support to challenge the domination of established unions. The court held that <b>section 23(1)(d)</b> promoted and served the goals of collective bargaining, which was a legitimate legislative end.</p>\n", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "", "dissent": "", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "NewNationMovementNPCandOthersvPresidentoftheRepublicofSouthAfricaandOthers", "href": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2020/11.html", "title": "\nNew Nation Movement NPC and Others v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others", "featured": false, "highlighted": true, "dateOfJudgment": "2020-06-11T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_1__Republic_of_South_Africa", "sec_19__Political_Rights"], "justicesConcurring": "\nJustice Cameron, Justice Froneman, Justice Jafta, Justice Khampepe, Justice Madlanga,  Acting Justice Mathopo, Justice Mhlantla, Justice Theron, Acting Justice Victor", "summary": "The four applicants, except for the second applicant, all involved Non-Governmental organisations or associations. The second applicant, a natural person described herself as a representative of Khoi and San communities and a princess of the Korona Royal Household of the Khoi and the San First Nation. It appears that the objectives of the applicants to an extent were similiar and they were essentially averse to joining or forming a political party and believed that the current electoral system infinged on their constitutional rights.The applicants  applied to the Western Cape High Court on an urgent basis to declare <b>the Electoral Act 73 of 1998</b> unconstitutional to the extent that an individual could not contest tha national and provincial elections. The matter was heard on an urgent basis as the national elections were to be held in a few weeks. \n\n<p>The Western Cape High Court dismissed the matter on 17 April 2019 and the aApplicants then urgently applied for direct leave to appeal the Western Cape High Court judgment to the Constitutional Court on 19 April 2019. In light of the pending elections, the  Constitutional Court only heard arguments on the question of the urgency of the matter on 2 May 2019.  The Constitutional Court held that the Applicants did not make out a case for urgency and postponed the matter to be argued on 15 August 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The New Nation Movement judgment declared the Electoral Act of 1998 unconstitutional, to the extent that individuals can only be elected to the National Assembly and Provincial Legislature through membership of their political parties. It is, however, important to note that the Constitutional Court did not consider what electoral system would be more appropriate, as this falls within the mandate of Parliament, and hence the Order was suspended for two years in order for Parliament to remedy the defect.</p>  \n\n<p>The constitutional challenge in the judgment was essentially distilled to two critical aspects. Firstly, the meaning of <b>section 19(3)(b) of the Constitution</b>, which states that <b>\u201cEvery adult citizen has the right (b) to stand for public office and if, elected, to hold office\u201d</b> had to be determined. Secondly, the Court had to determine whether <b>section 57A of the Electoral Act</b>, read with <b>schedule 1A of the Act</b> (which, in effect, required a citizen to be a member of a political party to contest national and provincial elections) unjustifiably limited an individual\u2019s right to freedom of association, provided for in <b>section 18 of the Constitution</b>. The question was approached holistically by Madlanga J who held that that <b>section 19(3)(b) of the Constitution</b> must be read not only in conjunction with the right to freedom of association but also with other political rights in s 19 of the Constitution.  Madlanga J held that the choice to form a political party in terms of <b>section 19(1)</b> equally includes the right not to join a political party. If <b>section 19(3)(b)</b> is read that only by joining a political party an individual can exercise the right to stand for public office, then it is in conflict with <b>section 19(1)</b>, which equally protects the choice not to join a political party.</p> \n\n<p>On the second aspect concerning the right to freedom of association, Madlanga J held that on consideration of foreign and international law, the right equally includes the right not to be forced to join an association. The question then turned to whether the limitation of the right to freedom of association by the Electoral Act could be justified as a reasonable limitation in terms of <b>section 36 of the Constitution</b>. The majority however found that the respondents were unable to justify on evidence  the limitation and  therefore the Electoral Act was held to be unconstitutional, to the extent that it excluded independent candidates to contest national and provincial elections.</p>\n\n<p>In the Constitution, <b>section 1</b> refers to the founding values of the Constitution. These values emphasise that the Republic of South Africa is \u201cone, sovereign, democratic state\u201d which is founded on various core value such as human dignity, non-racialism, supremacy of the Constitution and a multi-party system of democratic governance. It is  important to note that these  founding values form the premise of our constitutional order and in terms of the Constitution a high threshold is required to amend these provisions.</p>\n\n<p>In this judgment <b>section 1 (d) of the Constitution</b> was specifically considered as the Western Cape High Court held that the founding values of <b>section 1(d)</b> do not support the applicant\u2019s case. <b>Section 1(d) of the Constitution</b> provides that the founding values of the Republic include: \u201dUniversal adult suffrage, a national common voters roll, regular elections and a multi-party system of democratic government, to ensure accountability, responsiveness and openness\u201d. The applicants argued that <b>section 1(d) of the Constitution</b> cannot be read as requiring an exclusively party based proportional representation system.\n\n<p>The majority of the Constitutional Court on considering this aspect, held that section 1(d) of the Constitution says nothing about the exclusivity of multi-party representation. A multi-party democracy allows different political groups to organise and participate in an election but this does not mean only political groups can do so. In this regard the majority relied on the Constitutional Court judgment of United Democratic Movement v President of the Republic of South Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the importance of political rights with the South African context, <b>section 19(3)(b)</b> needed to be interpreted generously and not restrictively.\n\n<p><b>Section 19 (1)</p> enables a person not to form or join a political party and this should be protected as a political choice. Once a person is made to join a political party to exercise their <b>section 19(3)(b)</b> right, that means that the choice afforded to them by s 19(1) is no longer there.  The Electoral Act limits <b>section 19(3)(b)</b> because it makes it impossible for candidates to stand for political office without first being members of a political party. This limitation was not justified and it also was not reasonable.  The Electoral Act was unconstitutional to the extent that it limited <b>sections 19(1) and 19(3)(b)</b>. \n\n<p>The dissenting judgment was written by Froneman J, who agreed that leave to appeal should have been grantedn but disagreed with the reasoning and outcome on the merits of the appeal. Essentially Froneman J disagreed with the majority\u2019s interpretation of  \u201dto stand for public office and, if elected, to hold office\u201din <b>section 19(3)(b) of the Constitution</b> and held that it was not shown that the Constitution prescribes something other than political parties in its fundamental multi-party system of democratic governance.</p>\n\n\n\n", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "", "dissent": "", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "KhosaandOthersvMinisterofSocialDevelopmentandOthersMahlauleandAnothervMinisterofSocialDevelopment", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2004/11.html", "title": "\nKhosa and Others v Minister of Social Development and Others, Mahlaule and Another v Minister of Social Development", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2004-03-04T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_20__Citizenship"], "justicesConcurring": "Mokgoro J (Chaskalson CJ, Langa DCJ, Goldstone J, Moseneke J, O\u2019Regan J and Yacoob J) (majority) \nNgcobo J (Madala J) (minority)", "summary": "The applicants challenged certain provisions of the Social Assistance Act 59 of 1992 which disqualified persons who are not South African citizens from receiving certain welfare grants.

The applicants were all South African citizens.</p>\n\n<p>A majority of the Constitutional Court determined that: South African nationality entitles a person to ask the government to provide them with diplomatic protection; but that the government is generally only obliged to consider (and properly respond) to such requests, not to take the steps requested. The Court noted that nationality is generally gained when a person becomes a citizen.</p>\n\n<p>(i) \u2018Nationality\u2019 and \u2018citizenship\u2019 are different but related concepts.

Nationals are not permitted to raise international law protections themselves against other states, and are therefore obliged to seek protection through their state.

The applicant in the proceedings, Fuel Retailers Association of Southern Africa, an organisation which represents the interests of fuel retailers, objected the construction of the filing station stating that it will have an adverse impact on the environment.

The court held that the <b>National Enviromental Management Act of 1998</b> was enacted to give effect to <b>section 24 of the Constitution</b>, and that the act embraces the concept of sustainable development and requires people and their needs to be placed at the forefront of environmental management. The test to be applied in the cirsumstances is to assess, evaluate and consider whether the social, economic and environmental impact of the proposed development of the filling station was appropriately applied when the decision was taken to grant the application. Additionally, the test also requires that decisions must take into account the interests, needs and values of all interested and affected persons.</p>\n\n<p>The court held that the socio-economic development and the protection of the environment are interlinked. Therefore in this case the establishment of filling stations in close proximity to one another may increase the pre-existing risk of adverse impact on the environment. The risk of contamination of underground water, soil, visual intrusion and light. An additional filling station may significantly increase this risk and increase environmental stress. The filling station may also affect the sustainability of existing filling stations with consequences for the job security of the employees of those filling stations. The court held that the enviromental authorities did not consider  the impact of the increasing number of filling stations and of proposed filling station on existing ones.

It contemplates the integration of environmental protection and socio-economic development and envisages that the two will be balanced through the ideal of sustainable development.  The obligation of the environmental authorities to consider socio-economic factors includes the obligation to consider the impact of the increasing number of filling stations and of proposed filling station on existing ones. This obligation is wider than the requirement to assess need and desirability.  Court held that the authorities misconstrued the nature of their obligations and as a consequence failed to comply with a compulsory and material condition prescribed by the law for granting authorisation to establish a filling station. The court set aside the decision of the environmental authorities granting authorisation to construct the proposed filling station and ordered the environmental authorities to reconsider the application by Inama Trust in the light of the judgment.</p>\n\n<p>Sachs J dissenting judgement held that evidence does not indicate that opening a new filling station would pose or suggest any undue threat to the environment. That the question of sustainable development does not arise because this case does not require a decision on whether on balance the gains made in socio-economic development by opening up a new enterprise could appropriately permit a certain degree of negative impact on the environment. This matter was focused on the risk of overtrading and profits of existing petrol stations. This case is a question of the economic factor that should have been taken into account when the question of sustainable development was being considered. However, the question of possible overtrading is not one which decision-makers in this matter were called upon to consider.

The cultivation or use of virgin ground was considered to have a substantial detrimental effect on the environment in terms of <b>section 21(1) of the  Environmental Conservation Act of 1989 (ECA)</b> and therefore prohibited in terms of <b>section 22 of the ECA</b> unless written authorisation was granted. The respondent argued that  the land in question did not fall within the definition of \u201cvirgin land\u201d and therefore the construction activities were not subject to the authorisation in terms of the act. Accordingly, the respondent insisted that the first applicant did not have the legal basis for directing that development of the property must stop.\n\n<p>The case is concerned primarily with the interaction of two sections in the Environment Conservation Act of 1989 ( ECA), which allowed the applicant, the provincial Department for Agriculture, Conservation & Environment in Gauteng to prevent the development of a housing estate as a result of the applicants understanding that the development threatened the existence of certain Red Data species and naturally existing corridors that are formed by naturally formed geological ridges in Gauteng.

On applying the test for whether the deprivation was arbitrary or not, and therefore whether the deprivation was constitutional or not, the Court concluded that the deprivation (the seizure by SARS under section 114 of FNB\u2019s vehicles) was arbitrary and unconstitutional because there was insufficient reason justifying it: (i) There was no connection between the debt of the debtors and the owner of the property (FNB); (ii) There was no connection between the debt and the property (FNB\u2019s vehicles); (iii) The property owner (FNB) did not detriment SARS by placing the property (the vehicles) in the possession of the debtor (hence no reason why the property owner should be subjected to interference or sanction).</p>\n\n<p>(i) Section 25 mainly enshrines a negative protection of property (meaning that it protects or prevents existing property rights or property rights which come into existence from interference or intrusion), and does not enshrine the right to gain property rights.</p> \n\n<p>(ii) The Court indicated that one of the types of property included under <b>section 25</b>, in addition to land (see <b>section 25(4)(b)</b>), is \u2018tangible moveables\u2019 (physical, moveable things e.g. motor vehicles).</p>\n\n<p>(iii) \u2018Deprivation\u2019 is a wider term than and would include \u2018expropriation[s]\u2019 as contained in <b>section 25</b>: \u2018deprivation\u2019 refers to interference with (limitation on) the use or enjoyment of private property; whereas \u2018expropriation\u2019 means \u2018confiscation\u2019, \u2018taking\u2019 or \u2018dispossession\u2019 of the right or the property. (To determine whether deprivation is also an expropriation, the purpose of the law or conduct is assessed. If the purpose is to confiscate then the law or act expropriates.

Many had applied for subsidized low-cost housing through the municipality and had been on the waiting list for a period of up to seven years. While waiting to be allocated housing, they decided to move and illegally live on someones private land. Respondents were then evicted from these informal homes.Respondents applied to the High Court seeking an order requiring the government to provide them with adequate basic shelter or housing until they obtained permanent accommodation and certain relief. Respondents stated that <b>sections 26 and 28 of the Constitution of South Africa</b> guaranteed the right of everyone to access to adequate housing and the right of children to be afforded special protection, and, in particular, shelter. The appellants were ordered to provide the respondents with tents, portable latrines and a regular supply of water by way of minimal shelter. This decision formed the basis for the appeal to the Constitutional Court.\n\n<p>The court considered whether the measures taken by the state to realise the rights afforded by s26 of the consititution were reasonable. Whether the City of Cape Town\u2019s housing programmes met the obligations imposed on them by <b>section 26</b>.  The court found the right to access to adequate housing could not be seen in isolation; it had to be interpreted in the light of its close relationship with the other socio-economic rights.</p>\n\n<p>The court held that the state was obliged to take positive action to meet the needs of those living in extreme conditions of poverty, homelessness or intolerable housing. In this case the determination of a minimum obligation in the context of the right to have access to adequate housing presented difficult questions, because the needs of the respondents were so diverse.  The court held that the state therefore had to create the conditions for access to adequate housing for people at all economic levels of society. The extent of the state's obligation was defined by three key elements, which had to be considered separately: the obligation to take reasonable legislative and other measures, to achieve the progressive realisation of s26, and within available resources. For a person to have access to adequate housing, the court held, there had to be the provision of land, services (such as the provision of water, the removal of sewage and the financing of all these) and a dwelling.</p>\n\n<p>The court further held that <b>section 26</b> placed a obligation on the state and all other entities and persons to desist from preventing or impairing the right of access to adequate housing. The manner in which the eviction in this case had been carried out had resulted in a breach of this obligation.</p>\n\n<p>A reasonable housing program, capable of facilitating the realisation of the right, had clearly to allocate responsibilities and tasks to the different spheres of government and ensure that the appropriate financial and human resources were available to implement it. The formation of a program, however, was only the first stage in meeting the state's obligations. The program also had to be reasonably implemented, as failure to do so would not constitute compliance with the state's obligations. The court therefore issued a declaratory order which required the state to devise and implement a programme that included measures to provide relief.</p>\n\n<p>The Court first examined what the precise obligations of the government are under <b>section 26 of the Constitution</b>. In doing so, the Court stated that <b>section 26</b> must be interpreted in light of the remainder of the Constitution and the historical and social circumstances in which it is set. Section 26 requires that the state take reasonable legislative and other measures within the context of available resources to ensure access to adequate housing. The Court determined that the nationwide housing programme falls short of constitutional obligations insofar as it fails to provide relief for those in desperate need of housing.</p>\n\n<p>Further, the court confirmed that  the Constitution does not draw a distinction between housing, on one hand, and shelter on another. And so it concluded that that neither <b>section 26 nor section 28 of the Constitution</b> can be read to entitle respondents to claim shelter immediately upon demand. The Court then examined whether the respondents were entitled to broaden the scope of the original application so that persons without children would be equally entitled to shelter. To this the Court stated that under <b>section 26(2) of the Constitution</b>, the government is required to devise and implement, within its available resources, a comprehensive and coordinated program progressively to realize the right of access to adequate housing. This right extends to all individuals including those without children.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore the Constitutional Court declared that the government had not met its constitutional obligations and ordered the government, within its available resources, to devise, fund, implement and supervise measures to provide relief for all, including those without children, who are in desperate need.</p>\n\n", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "", "dissent": "", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "CityofJohannesburgMetropolitanMunicipalityvBlueMoonlightProperties", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2011/33.html ", "title": "\nCity of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality v Blue Moonlight Properties", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_26__Housing"], "justicesConcurring": "\nVan der Westhuizen J [  Moseneke DCJ, Cameron J, Froneman J, Jafta J, Khampepe J, Mogoeng J, Nkabinde J, Skweyiya J, Yacoob J ]", "summary": "This case concerns the conflict between the constitutional right to adequate housing and an owner\u2019s right to develop private property.  Eighty-six poor individuals were unlawfully occupying private unused industrial facilities as living quarters.  The owner of the property (Blue Moonlight) sued to evict the occupiers in order to develop the property, which would almost certainly render them homeless.  The occupiers argued that the city had an obligation to provide them with temporary housing under the Constitution and the <b>Prevention of Illegal Eviction and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act, 19 of 1998 (PIE Act)</b> before they could be evicted. \n\n<p>The court considered whether the 86 occupiers must be evicted to allow the owner to fully exercise its rights regarding its property and, if so, whether their eviction must be linked to an order that the City provide them with accommodation. The applicant\u2019s position is that it is neither obliged nor able to provide accommodation in these circumstances. The owner wishes to exercise its right to develop its property and wants no part in the dispute about the City\u2018s responsibilities or the plight of the occupiers. The court held that a court cannot grant an eviction order pursuant to the PIE Act unless it is just and equitable to do so.  In deciding whether an eviction is just and equitable, the court considered that many of the occupiers had lived on the property for a very long time, the occupation had once been lawful, Blue Moonlight was aware of the occupiers\u2019 presence when it purchased the property, and the eviction of the occupiers would render them homeless while there was no competing risk of homelessness on the part of Blue Moonlight.  The Court found that eviction would not be just or equitable until the city could provide the occupiers with alternate housing.  The court stated that in circumstances where an eviction of occupiers from private property would render the occupiers homeless, the rights of the property owners may have to temporarily yield to the occupiers\u2019 right to housing.</p>\n\n<p>The Court therefore ordered the city to provide the occupiers with adequate alternate housing. In so doing, the Court rejected the city\u2019s contention that the city did not have adequate financial resources with which to provide alternate housing.  Finally, the Court insisted that there be a link between the date of eviction and the date by which the city would have to provide such housing to ensure that the occupiers were not rendered homeless by the eviction.</p>\n\n<p>The court held that an owner's constitutional right not to be deprived of property, must be interpreted in a social and historical context and be balanced against the right of access to adequate housing and not to be evicted arbitrarily from one's home. In this case even though housing unlawful occupiers indefinitely suspends an owner's right to use and enjoy property, evictions can only be carried out in terms of the PIE act, and are only permissible where just and equitable.</p>\n\n<p>Whether it was just and equitable to order eviction under PIE act depended on whether the City had made reasonable efforts to provide alternative accommodation to the occupiers. The Court held that the City unreasonably and thus unconstitutionally breached the occupiers\u2019 right of access to adequate housing under s 26 of the Constitution by not providing them with temporary accommodation, in circumstances in which their imminent eviction would render them homeless.</p> \n\n<p>The City\u2019s claim that it lacked the resources to do so was rejected. The court therefore held that the occupiers had to vacate the properties by a given date, but stipulated that the City was to provide the evictees with \"temporary accommodation in a location as near as feasibly possible to the area\" in which the building was situated.</p>\n\n<p>The court emphasised that this case concerns temporary as defined in Chapter 12 and not permanent housing. The obligation, while derived from the right to progressive realisation of adequate housing in terms of <b>section 26(2) of the Constitution</b>, is distinct from the obligation to address permanent housing needs.</p>\n\n", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "", "dissent": "", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "MinisterofHealthandOthersvTreatmentActionCampaignandOthersNo", "href": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2002/15.html", "title": "Minister of Health and Others v Treatment Action Campaign and Others (No 2)", "featured": true, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2002-07-05T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_27__Healthcare,_Food,_Water_and_Security"], "justicesConcurring": "Chief Justice Chaskalson A ; Deputy Chief Justice Langa PN; Justice Ackermann L; Justice Goldstone RJ; Acting Justice Du Plessis B; Justice Kriegler JC;  Justice Madala T; Justice Ngcobo S; Justice O\u2019 Reagen K; Justice Sachs AL  and Acting Justice Skewyiya T", "summary": "The respondents in the Constitutional Court judgment concerned various civil society organisations and associations involved in the treatment of people with HIV/AIDS. The respondents launched a constitutional challenge in the North Gauteng High Court challenging the applicant\u2019s programme for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and provision of the anti-retroviral drug, Nevaripine at only certain limited research public healthcare facilities. The North Gauteng High Court made a structural interdict that obliged the State to extend the provision of Nevirapine to pregnant women with HIV beyond the limited public research facilities and to provide a comprehensive plan to prevent or reduce the prevention of HIV transmission from mother to child. The judgment was appealed by the applicants and the Constitutional Court specifically considered the applicants\u2019 policy in light of its constitutional obligations in terms of <b>sections 27(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution</b>.The Constitutional Court held that the applicants failed to fulfil their constitutional duty in this regard.\n\n<p>This Constitutional Court judgment is critical in understanding the obligations resting on the State in terms of <b>section 27(2) of the Constitution</b> in fulfilling access to a socio-economic right, in this regard specifically the constitutional right to access healthcare services. <b>Sections 27(1)(a)) of the Constitution</b> provides that everyone has the right to have access to health care services, that includes reproductive healthcare. The right however is not an absolute right against the State. The State must show it took \u201creasonable legislative and other measures, within its available resources\u201d to make the right available.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitutional Court essentially focused on two issues. Firstly,  the reasonability of  the applicant\u2019s policy that restricted  the provision of the anti-retroviral drug, Nevirapine to  pregnant women  at only certain public  healthcare training and research facilities. Secondly, the reasonability of the State\u2019s failure  develop a comprehensive programme to combat mother-to-child transmission of HIV in light of the State\u2019s obligations in terms of <b>sections 27(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution</b>.</p> \n\n<p>A key aspect that stood out in  analysing the reasonability of the applicants\u2019 policy restricting the provision of Nevaripine, was the applicants\u2019 failure  to take into account pregnant HIV mothers and their new-born children who do not have access to these public research sites. No provision was made for these extremely vulernable group of women.</p>\n\n<p>The North Gauteng High Court\u2019s structural interdict was set aside by the Constitutional Court  and the Constitutional Court made various detailed orders including  removing the  present restrictions on the administration of Nevirapine without delay.

However, the Court has a duty to determine whether these measures adopted are reasonable. In this regard the Constitutional Court relied strongly on the Constitutional Court judgment of Government of the Republic of South Africa and Others v Grootboom and Other that held :  <b>\u201cto be reasonable, measures cannot leave out of account the degree and extent of the denial of the right they endeavour to realise.

They had approached a company known as SA Multiloan in Stellenbosch for small loans. Later when they fell into arrears, the creditor provider demanded that they sign further documents which resulted in default judgments and emoluments attachment orders obtained by the credit providers. This allowed for the deduction of the judgment debt from their salaries or wages.\n\n<p>As a result of this, all the applicants approached the Law Clinic to institute proceedings in the High Court to have s65(J) declared unconstitutional. Their argument was that s65(J) allowed for emoluments attachment orders to be obtained without judicial oversight. The High Court agreed with them and declared the section unconstitutional and therefore invalid.</p>\n\n<p>Application was then filed to the Constitutional Court to confirm invalidity of s65(J). The majority judgment, written by Cameron J, disagreed with Jafta J\u2019s conclusion that it was possible to interpret s65J as providing for judicial oversight. S65J(2) licenses the issuing of an emoluments attachment order where the debtor consents in writing; or if \u201cthe court has so authorised\u201d. The conjunction \u201cor\u201d seems to make plain that an emoluments attachment order may be obtained through the debtor\u2019s written consent even when the court has not authorised it.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, s65J(1) posits that a judgment creditor, not a court, causes an emoluments attachment order to be issued from a court. And once issued, s65J(5) provides that the order may be executed \u201cas if it were a court judgment\u201d. This wording allows for execution without judicial oversight. The majority judgment therefore concluded that the plain language of the provision shows it permitted judicially unsanctioned enforcement of judgment debts. Therefore, the section was unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p>Zondo J concurred with the majority judgment but wrote separately. He took the view that in order for s65J(1)(a) to be read to mean that it is the court that issues emoluments attachment orders, one would have to read the phrase \u201cissued from the court\u201d to mean \u201cissued by the court\u201d. Zondo J held that there is no room for this interpretation.</p>\n  \n<p>The remedy adopted by Zondo J was supported by the majority. It was one of a combination of reading-in and severance and not the remedy adopted by the High Court. Accordingly, Zondo J did not confirm the order of constitutional invalidity made by the High Court, but rather ordered the reading-in, and severance of, certain words in section 65J(2)(a) and (b) in order to remedy the constitutional defect.</p>\n\n<p>Jafta J held that the High Court erred in proceeding from the premise that s65J(2) did not provide for judicial oversight without interpreting that section. He held that the Court was bound to determine for itself whether indeed the section failed to provide for judicial oversight.</p>\n\n<p>Jafta J held further that it should be determined whether the words \u201cfrom the court\u201d are capable of a meaning that accords with the assumed constitutional guarantee that, whenever execution is sought against one\u2019s property \u2013 regardless of whether movable or immovable \u2013 the execution must be subject to judicial oversight.</p>\n\n<p>Jafta J held that s65J indeed provides for judicial supervision. Therefore, assuming that the Constitution requires judicial supervision when emoluments attachment orders are issued, the section meets the requirement. Jafta J added that in these circumstances he cannot confirm the order of invalidity made by the High Court.</p>\n\n<p>The majority held that a debtor\u2019s section 34 right of access to court is breached when an execution process against any form of property occurs without judicial oversight of a court.</p>", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "", "dissent": "", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "ABandAnothervMinisterofSocialDevelopment", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2016/43.html ", "title": "\nAB and Another v Minister of Social Development", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2016-11-29T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_36__Limitations_of_Rights"], "justicesConcurring": "\nNkabinde J [ Mogoeng CJ, Moseneke DCJ, Bosielo AJ, Jafta J, Mhlantla J and Zondo J] [majority]\n\nKhampepe J [ Cameron J, Froneman J and Madlanga J concurring ] [ minority] ", "summary": "", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "", "dissent": "", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "FosevMinisterofSafetyandSecurity", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1997/6.html ", "title": "Fose v Minister of Safety and Security\n", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "1997-06-05T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_38__Enforcement_of_Rights"], "justicesConcurring": "Ackermann J [Chaskalson P, Mahomed DP, Langa J, Madala J, Mokgoro J and Sachs J O'Regan J] [majority]\n\nDidcott J and Kriegler J [separate concurring] \n", "summary": "The applicant stated that members of the South African Police Services violated his fundamental rights by widespread and persistent form of abuses including series of assaults and torture over a two day period.

That is, whether the court should award damages to the applicant which aim to punish or deter government from future similar acts.</p> \n\n<p>The court held that this question is answered on a case by case basis and when determining the answer to this question courts must look at the following; what relief will best ensure protection and enforcement of the constitutional rights and where necessary innovative remedies can apply, the relief must vindicate the infringed right and an appropriate relief may be achieved in the general claims of damages. In this case the court found that it would be inappropriate to award punitive constitutional damages in addition to the compensatory damages already awarded to the applicant. The court further held that damages against government would not have the intended impact of deterrence unless the money awarded was substantial in nature. The result of this would deplete already limited state resources and place the burden on tax payers.

Therefore his constitutional rights would be effectively vindicated without the awarding of constitutional damages. The court held that determining appropriate relief must be done according to the facts of the individual case. The relief must be one that effectively protects, enforces and vindicates the constitutional right which has been contravened. The court further held that courts will be required in certain instances to be innovative in ensuring that relief is achieved.</p>\n \n<p>The court further held that punitive constitutional damages awarded against the government would not have the intended impact of deterrence unless the money awarded was substantial in nature.

Future considerations of punitive damages similar to the one claimed in this case must be introduced by law and not through judicial innovation as suggested in the majority judgment.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Kriegler held that the vindication as mentioned requires special consideration. That the purpose of the section is to ensure that certain violations are addressed and if they are not, it will result in loss of faith in the constitution.

The High Court dismissed the applicant's claim and the Supreme Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that the police and prosecution did not owe her a duty of protection.

The applicant argued that due consideration should have given prior to the release of the accused particularly given the prevalence of gender-based violence in South Africa, there should have been a special concern by the state as a constitutional obligation not to do anything that could further the possibility of violence.
