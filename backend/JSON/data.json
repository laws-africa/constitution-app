The University\u2019s previous policy, adopted in 2014, established English and Afrikaans as languages of instruction (with interpretation). Compared to the 2016 Policy, the 2014 Policy would have cost an additional R640 million in infrastructure, plus about R78 million per year thereafter, entailing a 20% increase in fees (R8100 on top of the approximately R40 000 per year per student). The 2016 Policy makes teaching primarily English: teaching is in both English and Afrikaans \u2018where reasonably practicable and pedagogically sound\u2019 (parallel medium); and where demand is insufficient and recourses do not permit, only Afrikaans translations are provided, coupled with questions and answers in Afrikaans (as opposed to real-time interpreting). At the time of the judgment, Afrikaans was still offered on large scale at undergraduate level; all first-year lectures continue to be offered in Afrikaans; any student could be taught in English.\n\nFollowing an extensive and exhaustive process, and in the wake of Fees Must Fall and Open Stellenbosch upheavals on its campus in 2015, the University of Stellenbosch adopted a new language policy in 2016 under the Higher Education Act and the National Language Policy for Higher Education (LPHE) to replace its 2014 policy which would have cost the University millions more Rands in infrastructure and annual operational costs, resulting in fee increases.

Finally, they asserted that Mr Zuma\u2019s right to a fair trial in terms of section 35(3) of the Constitution had been threatened because the warrants did not sufficiently protect his legal professional privilege. ", "facts": "\nThe applicant investigated an agreement that was entered into by the respondent and Bankorp Limited during the apartheid era.        \n\nIn her final report, the applicant directed that the Chairperson of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee take steps to amend the Constitution to strip the respondent of its primary object of protecting the value of the currency and amend its consulting obligations with the Minister of Finance.\n\nThe report also recommended that the Special Investigating Unit approach the President and take steps to recover misused public funds from ABSA Bank Limited who had purchased Bankorp . \n\n", "decision": "Holding public officials personally responsible for costs in cases against them is a constitutional mechanism that ensures that they act in good faith and in line with the relevant laws and the Constitution. \r\nThe applicant had acted in bad faith and had exceeded the bounds of her powers and as such, she wasn\u2019t afforded protection under the Public Protector Act. \r\nThe applicant also failed to engage with the respondent and allow them to make representations before publishing her final report. \r\nThat the applicant had misrepresented herself under oath and her behaviour was found to be contradictory further confirming that she acted in bad faith. \r\n \r", "dissent": "The majority judgement written by Khampepe J and Theron J (Basson AJ, Cameron J, Dlodlo AJ, Froneman J, Mhlantla J and Petse AJ concurring) agreed with the High Court that the behaviour of the applicant was in bad faith and fell short of the standards imposed by her office. As a result, the personal costs order made against her was justified. \r\n\r\nThe minority judgement written by Mogoeng CJ (Goliath AJ concurring) decided that the courts exist not as places to crush litigants but to teach them and caution constructively.

The respondent was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. In 1997 he however applied for amnesty under the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 and was granted it in 2001. In 2003 the respondent was a candidate to head the Ekurhuleni metro police. The appellant in September and October 2003 published various articles and editorials questioning the respondent\u2019s candidacy and expressed the view that he was a \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cmurdered\u201d. Some of the articles failed to mention that the respondent was granted amnesty by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the respondent sued the appellant and other journalists for defamation in the Witwatersrand Local Division (South Gauteng High Court), arguing that the articles were malicious as he was granted amnesty. The respondent was successful in the High Court with the defamation claim and the appellants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court of Appeal only partially upheld the appeal and reduced the amount of damages awarded to the respondent. The appellants then appealed to the constitutional Court against the Supreme Court of Appeal judgment and the respondent cross-appealed the reduction in damages awarded by the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n\nThe key issue the Constitutional Court had to determine was how amnesty granted to the respondent for crimes committed (during the struggle against apartheid) by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission affected a claim for defamation. The respondent was granted amnesty in terms of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 for crimes committed in 1986. In 2003 the appellants in various commentary covering the candidacy of the respondent for the position of head of the Erkhuleni Metro police referred to the respondent as a \u201cmurderer\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d. Justice Cameron writing for the majority geld that the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 did not make the fact that the respondent committed murder untrue and the Act did not prohibit frank public discussion. Justice Cameron emphasised that the requirement that a comment must be \u201dfair\u201d  protects criticism even if it is extreme so long it is without malice, on a matter of public interest and  on facts that are true. The Constitutional Court therefore upheld the appellant\u2019s main appeal and dismissed the respondent\u2019s cross appeal but the Court did find that the appellant had defamed the respondent by claiming falsely that he was not contrite and awarded the respondent damages on this aspect.", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "As the matter essentially concerned a defamation claim and the defences raised thereto a key issue the Constitutional Court had to decide was, how to find a balance between two constitutional rights, namely the appellant\u2019s right to freedom of expression on the one hand and the respondent\u2019s right to human dignity. Justice Cameron writing for the majority, emphasised that the right to human dignity is not only given separate constitutional recognition in s 10 of the Constitution but is also one of the founding values of the society terms of s 1. Therefore, a failure to uphold the right is not only a violation of s10 but is also a threat to a founding value underpinning the legitimacy of the State. However importantly Cameron J, pointed out that freedom of expression is just as important as human dignity and one cannot say that human dignity trumps freedom of expression. The law of defamation importantly must be interpreted to give effect to the appropriate balance between the right to freedom of expression on the one hand and a person\u2019s human dignity on the other hand. Cameron J held on this interpretation that the requirement that a comment must be \u201cfair\u201d in defence to a claim for defamation gives effect to the balance between the right to freedom of expression and dignity.", "dissent": "Partial dissenting judgments were written by Ngcobo J and Mogoeng J. Justice Ngcobo agreed with the majority judgment that the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 did not make the facts of the commission of the murders untrue but Ngcobo J held that the balancing of the right to freedom and the right to dignity  required the facts upon which the appellant relied in their comment to include the fact that the respondent was granted amnesty by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission. However, on reading the coverage of the respondent\u2019s candidacy collectively Ngcobo J found that this fact was adequately stated. Justice Ngcobo however held that since the appellant failed to make reference to the circumstances under which the appellant was released from detention in Mozambique the statement of the appellant concerning gun-running allegations in Mozambique was based on \u201chalf-truths\u201d and therefore was untrue, justifying the respondent\u2019s cross appeal. Justice Mogoeng in his judgment specifically held that the defamatory statements that the respondent was a \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cmurder \u201cmust be determined within the context of the objective of the amnesty process and that the truth told during the amnesty process was not meant to be used in a manner that defeats the purpose of national reconciliation. Justice Mogoeng held that the defamatory statements that the respondent was a \u201cmurderer\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d was malicious and was contrary to the pursuit of national reconciliation.

It is important to note that the trial was concluded before the Interim Constitution (also known as the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,1993)  came into operation and therefore the constitutionality of the death sentence was not considered  at the trial itself.\n\nChaskalson J,writing for the majority  essentially found that such an extreme form of punishment putting an end to the right to life itself and infringing on  various other constitutional rights, especially the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, could not be justified as  reasonable in terms of the limitation test in s33 of the Interim Constitution. The Constitutional Court declared  the death penalty unconstitutional.\n\nThe Constitutional Court was principally concerned with the question whether the death penalty in terms of s 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 was in conflict with various provisions of the then Interim Constitution such as the right to life, dignity and the prohibition against \u201ccruel, inhuman or degrading punishment\u201d. \n\nChaskalson P, considered various foreign judgment  and decisions of International Human Rigs  Tribunals  that  emphasised that \u201dcruel, inhuman and degrading punishment\u201d is in clear contrast to the right of dignity which is also a  founding value of the South African Constitution.\n\nChaskalson P, applied the limitation of rights test in terms of s 33 of the Interim Constitution,which involves a two-stage test to determine  whether the limitation on a constitutional right is reasonable, necessary and proportional taking into account all competing rights.

The majority judgment written by Chaskalson P, in fact focused more on the justification of the death sentence in relation to the right not to be subject on \u201ccruel, inhuman and degrading punishment\u201d in light of alternative severe sentences such as life imprisonment. It is however  important to note that Chaskalson P held that although the right to life is stated in unqualified terms, the right itself must accommodate the right to kill in lawful self-defence of one\u2019s own life or the lives of others. \n\n<p>The concurring judgment of O\u2019Reagen dealt more with the right to life and O\u2019 Reagen J  explicitly held that the death sentence was also a breach of the right to life and dignity. O\u2019Reagen J,  held that the meaning of the right to life must be considered in light of its purpose for which it was included in the Constitution. O\u2019Reagen J emphasised that the right to life is interlinked with the right to dignity and was included in the Constitution not only to preserve the right to existence but includes the right to experience humanity and is central to a society where every individual is recognised and valued.</p> [sec_11]\n\n<p>The constitutional <b>right to dignity</b> directly comes into question on consideration of the constitutionality of the death penalty.

The facts relavnt to this matter is that in both matters the applicants were summoned for examination in terms of s 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 in the winding-up process of two companies. In both cases the applicants objected to being compelled to answer questions put to them that might tend to incriminate them and they applied to the Witwatersrand Local Division of the Supreme Court for a temporary interdict against the respondents, prohibiting further interrogation pending the determination of the constitutionality of s 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act.

Ackerman J writing for the majority analysed whether section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act 633 of 1971 firstly limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>, relating to the right to freedom and security of the person. Ackerman J emphasised that a broad interpretation should be given at this stage of the entrenched right as the second stage of the limitation test involving <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> prescribes the criteria that has to be met before an entrenched right can be limited. Ackerman held that s 417(2)(b) limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> and then turned to the second stage of the limitation test. The second stage involved analysing whether this limitation could be justified as reasonable in a democratic society taking into account the prescribed factors in <b>section 33 (1) of the Interim Constitution</b>. Ackerman J, importantly emphasised in this matter that the onus is on the party relying on the legislation to justify the limitation in terms of <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> and not for the party challenging it.
